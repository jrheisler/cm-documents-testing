  "summary": "Roger meets up with Frank, who promised to show him the hidden world of the cities less fortunate. They make their way through a labyrinth, ducking under low-hanging clotheslines and avoiding puddles of questionable liquid. The air reeked of stale urine and rotting garbage, stark reminders of the harsh realities of life on the streets."
