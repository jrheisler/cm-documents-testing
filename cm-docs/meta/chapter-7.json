  "summary": "A man strolled down the boardwalk in Ocean City, Maryland. He was over six feet tall, wearing faded blue jeans that had come in and out of style a dozen times in the last half-century. The man had gone by several names over the years. The one that he had gravitated toward recently was Rex."
