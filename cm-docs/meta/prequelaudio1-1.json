  "summary": "Randal was always the first up the hill and the last off of the shooting range. He was there when the blast wave hit; I saw hundreds turn to ash...” He takes another swig from a bottle; he makes no effort to hide it. “But you’re alive, right? That’s what matters,” I say as I pat him on the shoulder. Next thing I know, I’m being pulled away in a stretcher."
