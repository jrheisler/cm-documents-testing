  "summary": "\"I believe that no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time recovered her grasp of the ACT,\" says the author. \"It came to me in the very horror of the immediate presence that the act would be, seeing and facing what I saw and faced, to keep the boy himself unaware\" \"The inspiration—I can call it by no other name—was that I felt how voluntarily, how transcendently, I might,\" adds the writer."
