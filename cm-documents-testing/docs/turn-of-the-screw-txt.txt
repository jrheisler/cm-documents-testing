THE TURN OF THE SCREW 
BY 
HENRY JAMES 
  
1898
The Turn Of The Screw By Henry James. 




CHAPTER 1::

AT RISE:
The stage is dimly lit, evoking an air of mystery and suspense. The set suggests a Victorian country house, with a modest, well-kept drawing room on one side, and a glimpse of an open window to the outdoors. A stone staircase is visible, leading up to an upper floor, and a window with sheer curtains allows the last golden light of an afternoon sun to spill onto the floor. The setting is tranquil but filled with subtle unease, as if something is hidden just out of sight.

SOUND:
Faint birdsong can be heard in the distance, mingling with the occasional creak of old floorboards, hinting at the house’s age. There is a gentle rustle of the wind outside, brushing against the window.

LIGHTING:
Soft, warm light shines from a candle-lit table, suggesting warmth inside the house. Shadows stretch across the room, hinting at something unnerving lurking beneath the surface of this seemingly peaceful home.

DIRECTION:
The Governess enters from stage left, her footsteps soft on the old wood, as she looks around the room, taking in her new surroundings. She wears a simple but elegant dress, her demeanor calm, but with a slight nervousness in her movements. She carries a small suitcase, setting it gently on a nearby chair. She surveys the room carefully, seemingly measuring it with her eyes, her expression one of both curiosity and tension. The atmosphere is quiet, but there is a subtle underlying tension—something feels a little off.

GOVERNESS:
(to herself, quietly, as she surveys the room)
I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong.

DIRECTION:
A soft knock is heard at the door. The Governess straightens, glancing toward it. Mrs. Grose enters stage right, carrying a tray with a teapot and two cups. She’s a sturdy, simple woman, with a kind but slightly reserved demeanor.

MRS. GROSE:
Ah, miss. Welcome to Bly. You’ve arrived just in time for a lovely afternoon.

DIRECTION:
Governess smiles politely, looking relieved at the warm greeting.

GOVERNESS:
(with a slight sense of wonder)
Yes, thank you. It’s a beautiful day... I feel already that it will be a new beginning.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose sets the tray down on the table.

MRS. GROSE:
And it will be, miss. You’ll find us here, simple and full of charm. You’ll be quite at home, I’m sure.

DIRECTION:
She moves toward the window, looking outside.

MRS. GROSE:
We’ll have young Flora with us tonight—her little bed is all ready in your room, miss.

GOVERNESS:
(noticing the tranquil beauty of the garden through the window, almost dreamily)
The garden... how lovely. It feels like a place from a fairytale.

MRS. GROSE:
(smiling, but with a slight hint of caution)
Yes, miss, a storybook place... for some.

DIRECTION:
The Governess glances at Mrs. Grose, unsure of her tone.

GOVERNESS:
(curiously, turning towards Mrs. Grose)
And... the other child, the boy—Miles. Is he as... remarkable?

MRS. GROSE:
(beaming, clearly proud of the children)
Oh, miss, MOST remarkable. If you think well of this one!

GOVERNESS:
(leaning forward, intrigued)
Yes; if I do—?

MRS. GROSE:
You WILL be carried away by the little gentleman!

GOVERNESS:
(with a half-laugh, gently)
Well, that, I think, is what I came for—to be carried away. I'm afraid, however, I'm rather easily carried away. I was carried away in London!

MRS. GROSE:
(gently nodding, her expression thoughtful)
In Harley Street?

GOVERNESS:
(nodding, with a smile)
In Harley Street.

MRS. GROSE:
(more quietly, as though sharing a secret)
Well, miss, you're not the first—and you won’t be the last.

GOVERNESS:
(laughing softly, then growing serious)
Oh, I've no pretension to being the only one. My other pupil, at any rate, comes back tomorrow?

MRS. GROSE:
(happily nodding, with a slight smile)
Not tomorrow—Friday, miss. He arrives, as you did, by the coach, under care of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.

GOVERNESS:
(nodding, feeling reassured)
Then it is settled. I’ll be in waiting for him, with his sister.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose smiles again, setting a tray down and stepping back to give the Governess space to settle into her new role. The Governess watches her, and for the first time, there’s a subtle unease in the air.

DIRECTION:
The sound of birds fades into the background, replaced by a slight rustle, an almost imperceptible sound. The Governess looks around, a shiver runs down her spine. Her thoughts become distant, her mind beginning to wander. She glances at Flora’s small bed, then back at the window, where the last light of day begins to fade. A tension lingers in the air, unseen but palpable.

GOVERNESS:
I remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong.

GOVERNESS:
After rising, in town, to meet his appeal, I had at all events a couple of very bad days—found myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure I had made a mistake.

DIRECTION:
She rides the long, bumping, swinging coach to the stopping place.

GOVERNESS:
This convenience, I was told, had been ordered.

DIRECTION:
A commodious fly is waiting in the golden light of a June afternoon.

GOVERNESS:
Driving at that hour, on a lovely day, through a country that offered me a friendly welcome, my fortitude mounted afresh.

DIRECTION:
They turn into the avenue. The lawn, flowers, and house emerge grandly.

GOVERNESS:
I suppose I had dreaded something melancholy, but what greeted me was a good surprise.

GOVERNESS:
I remember the broad, clear front, the open windows, fresh curtains, and the pair of maids looking out.

DIRECTION:
She arrives at the house. A civil person curtsies with a little girl in her hand.

GOVERNESS:
I had received in Harley Street a narrower notion of the place. This made me think the proprietor even more of a gentleman.

DIRECTION:
Night falls. She meets Flora.

GOVERNESS:
The little girl who accompanied Mrs. Grose appeared to me on the spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have to do with her.

GOVERNESS:
She was the most beautiful child I had ever seen.

DIRECTION:
The governess paces restlessly in her room.

GOVERNESS:
The room was large and impressive—one of the best in the house.

GOVERNESS:
The great state bed, the figured draperies, the long mirrors—I could see myself from head to foot.

DIRECTION:
She reflects on her good fortune, the generous appointment, and Flora’s charm.

GOVERNESS:
I should get on with Mrs. Grose. That, at least, seemed certain.

DIRECTION:
They dine. Flora sits in a high chair, brightly facing her.

GOVERNESS:
There were things, in Flora’s presence, that could pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks.

GOVERNESS:
And the little boy—does he look like her? Is he too so very remarkable?

MRS. GROSE:
Oh, miss, MOST remarkable. If you think well of this one!

GOVERNESS:
Yes; if I do—?

MRS. GROSE:
You WILL be carried away by the little gentleman!

GOVERNESS:
Well, that, I think, is what I came for—to be carried away. I'm afraid, however, I'm rather easily carried away. I was carried away in London!

MRS. GROSE:
In Harley Street?

GOVERNESS:
In Harley Street.

MRS. GROSE:
Well, miss, you're not the first—and you won't be the last.

GOVERNESS:
Oh, I've no pretension to being the only one. My other pupil, at any rate, comes back tomorrow?

MRS. GROSE:
Not tomorrow—Friday, miss. He arrives, as you did, by the coach, under care of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.

DIRECTION:
They agree the governess will meet Miles at the coach with Flora.

GOVERNESS:
What I felt the next day was nothing that could be fairly called a reaction—but perhaps a slight oppression.

DIRECTION:
She walks the grounds with Flora.

GOVERNESS:
She only would show me the place.

DIRECTION:
Flora leads her step by step, room by room.

GOVERNESS:
I was struck with her confidence and courage—on staircases, in empty chambers, in the tower. Her morning music led me on.

GOVERNESS:
Wasn't it just a storybook over which I had fallen adoze and adream?

DIRECTION:
She watches Bly in the early dawn. A sound—or is it a memory?—a cry, a footstep.

GOVERNESS:
There had been a moment when I believed I recognized the cry of a child.

GOVERNESS:
Another when I found myself starting at the passage of a light footstep.

GOVERNESS:
To watch, teach, form little Flora would be the making of a happy and useful life.

DIRECTION:
They prepare Flora’s small white bed in the governess’s room.

GOVERNESS:
She had remained just this last time with Mrs. Grose out of consideration for my strangeness and her natural timidity.

GOVERNESS:
In spite of this timidity, she had been perfectly frank and brave about it.

GOVERNESS:
I feel quite sure she would presently like me.

DIRECTION:
The governess and Mrs. Grose dine by candlelight, Flora between them.

GOVERNESS:
It was part of what I already liked Mrs. Grose for—the pleasure I saw her take in my admiration.



































CHAPTER 2::

AT RISE:
A soft, misty morning. The countryside road winds through tall hedges and dew-kissed fields. A simple carriage moves slowly along the lane. The GOVERNESS and FLORA ride together. The girl is lively, gazing out the window. The GOVERNESS is quiet, thoughtful, her mind elsewhere.

SOUND:
The rhythmic creak of carriage wheels. Occasional birdsong, fading into a hush. The countryside is calm, but underlined by unease.

LIGHTING:
Filtered light through the carriage window. Gentle shadows move across the GOVERNESS’S face, emphasizing her inner conflict.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS sits upright, holding a letter in her lap. She glances down at it occasionally, but does not open it. Her eyes remain distant, her thoughts heavy.

NARRATOR:
This came home to me when, two days later, I drove over with Flora to meet, as Mrs. Grose said, the little gentleman; and all the more for an incident that, presenting itself the second evening, had deeply disconcerted me.

DIRECTION:
Flashback. A warm firelight glow. The GOVERNESS alone in her room, holding the letter, unopened.

NARRATOR:
The first day had been, on the whole, as I have expressed, reassuring; but I was to see it wind up in keen apprehension. The postbag, that evening—it came late—contained a letter for me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found to be composed but of a few words enclosing another, addressed to himself, with a seal still unbroken.

DIRECTION:
She paces. The letter still sealed. Her hand trembles slightly. She places it on the writing desk. Then picks it up again.

NARRATOR:
I broke the seal with a great effort—so great a one that I was a long time coming to it; took the unopened missive at last up to my room and only attacked it just before going to bed. I had better have let it wait till morning, for it gave me a second sleepless night.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS lies awake in bed, staring into the darkness. The letter now open on her nightstand. Her mind is spinning.

NARRATOR:
With no counsel to take, the next day, I was full of distress; and it finally got so the better of me that I determined to open myself at least to Mrs. Grose.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS walks with purpose through a hallway, clutching the letter. She knocks softly on a door.

GOVERNESS:
What does it mean? The child’s dismissed his school.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose appears in her night wrapper, surprised but concerned. She gestures the GOVERNESS inside.

MRS. GROSE:
But aren’t they all—?

GOVERNESS:
Sent home—yes. But only for the holidays. Miles may never go back at all.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose stiffens. She steps back slightly, visibly unsettled.

MRS. GROSE:
They won’t take him?

GOVERNESS:
They absolutely decline.

DIRECTION:
Silence. The two women stand apart. A fire burns low nearby.

MRS. GROSE:
What has he done?

GOVERNESS:
I—I thought I should let you read this.

DIRECTION:
She holds out the letter. Mrs. Grose does not take it.

MRS. GROSE:
Such things are not for me, miss.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS sits, unfolds the paper, and begins to read, her voice quiet.

GOVERNESS:
Is he really BAD?

MRS. GROSE:
Do the gentlemen say so?

GOVERNESS:
They go into no particulars. They simply express their regret that it should be impossible to keep him. That can have only one meaning.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose shakes her head, refusing to accept it.

MRS. GROSE:
Master Miles! HIM an injury?

GOVERNESS:
To his poor little innocent mates!

MRS. GROSE:
It’s too dreadful, to say such cruel things! Why, he’s scarce ten years old.

GOVERNESS:
Yes, yes; it would be incredible.

MRS. GROSE:
See him, miss, first. THEN believe it!

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS rises quickly, her resolve sharp.

GOVERNESS:
I will—right away.

DIRECTION:
She heads toward the door. Mrs. Grose follows after her.

MRS. GROSE:
You might as well believe it of the little lady. Bless her, look at her!

DIRECTION:
Flora stands at the threshold, a vision of innocence in her nightgown. She smiles warmly at the GOVERNESS.

GOVERNESS:
I’ve found her.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS kneels, embracing Flora. The girl rests her head on the woman’s shoulder. Mrs. Grose watches them, but there is no peace in her eyes. The fire flickers. The wind whispers at the window.

BLACKOUT.

























CHAPTER 3::

AT RISE:
The drawing room, early morning. A haze of light filters through the windows. Outside, the mist clings to the grass. A sense of hush—almost reverence—fills the air. MRS. GROSE stands near the hearth, her back partially turned. The GOVERNESS enters quietly from the side.

SOUND:
A ticking clock. Distant birds. The quiet hush of dawn.

LIGHTING:
Soft grey morning tones gradually warm as the scene progresses.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS watches MRS. GROSE turn away but remains undeterred. She feels a growing connection with the woman, despite the tension between them.

NARRATOR:
Her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not, for my just preoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem.

DIRECTION:
Flashback—two days prior. The GOVERNESS and FLORA travel in a carriage.

NARRATOR:
We met, after I had brought home little Miles, more intimately than ever on the ground of my stupefaction, my general emotion: so monstrous was I then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now been revealed to me should be under an interdict.

DIRECTION:
A quaint inn. The GOVERNESS exits the carriage. MILES stands outside, gazing hopefully.

NARRATOR:
I was a little late on the scene, and I felt, as he stood wistfully looking out for me before the door of the inn at which the coach had put him down, that I had seen him, on the instant, without and within, in the great glow of freshness, the same positive fragrance of purity, in which I had, from the first moment, seen his little sister.

DIRECTION:
MILES smiles gently as she approaches. She kneels, taking his hand.

NARRATOR:
He was incredibly beautiful, and Mrs. Grose had put her finger on it: everything but a sort of passion of tenderness for him was swept away by his presence.

DIRECTION:
Back at Bly, the GOVERNESS and MILES ride in the carriage. Her face glows, but something clouds it.

NARRATOR:
What I then and there took him to my heart for was something divine that I have never found to the same degree in any child—his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in the world but love.

DIRECTION:
She watches him, deeply moved.

NARRATOR:
It would have been impossible to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence, and by the time I had got back to Bly with him I remained merely bewildered—so far, that is, as I was not outraged—by the sense of the horrible letter locked up in my room, in a drawer.

DIRECTION:
Later. The GOVERNESS sits with MRS. GROSE in hushed conversation.

GOVERNESS:
What does it mean? The child’s dismissed his school.

MRS. GROSE:
But aren’t they all—?

GOVERNESS:
Sent home—yes. But only for the holidays. Miles may never go back at all.

DIRECTION:
MRS. GROSE freezes, shocked. Her hands tremble.

MRS. GROSE:
They won’t take him?

GOVERNESS:
They absolutely decline.

DIRECTION:
MRS. GROSE turns away, shielding her eyes.

MRS. GROSE:
What has he done?

GOVERNESS:
I—I thought I should let you read this.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS offers the letter.

MRS. GROSE:
Such things are not for me, miss.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS frowns, realization dawning.

GOVERNESS:
Is he really BAD?

MRS. GROSE:
Do the gentlemen say so?

GOVERNESS:
They go into no particulars. They simply express their regret that it should be impossible to keep him. That can have only one meaning.

DIRECTION:
MRS. GROSE’s face darkens. Her jaw sets.

MRS. GROSE:
Master Miles! HIM an injury?

GOVERNESS:
To his poor little innocent mates!

MRS. GROSE:
It’s too dreadful, to say such cruel things! Why, he’s scarce ten years old.

GOVERNESS:
Yes, yes; it would be incredible.

MRS. GROSE:
See him, miss, first. THEN believe it!

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS rises swiftly.

GOVERNESS:
I will—right away.

DIRECTION:
MRS. GROSE hurries after her.

MRS. GROSE:
You might as well believe it of the little lady. Bless her, look at her!

DIRECTION:
FLORA enters, radiant and joyful. The GOVERNESS softens at once.

GOVERNESS:
I’ve found her.

DIRECTION:
She embraces FLORA tightly. Her love for the children flickers—bright but troubled. A silence follows, uneasy.

BLACKOUT.




















CHAPTER 4::

AT RISE:
The hall at Bly, evening. The white-paneled walls glow under the light of oil lamps. Portraits peer down in silence. Outside, a thin wind stirs the trees. Within, a heaviness hangs—expectant, spectral.

SOUND:
Distant wind. A soft ticking clock. Floorboards faintly creaking under footfall.

LIGHTING:
Dim and warm at center stage, falling off quickly into shadows at the edges. The darkness presses in from windows and doorways.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS enters slowly from the garden, her expression dazed and inward. She closes the door quietly behind her, then stands motionless.

NARRATOR:
It was not that I didn’t wait, on this occasion, for more, for I was rooted as deeply as I was shaken.

DIRECTION:
She begins to pace, slow and deliberate.

NARRATOR:
Was there a "secret" at Bly—a mystery of Udolpho or an insane, an unmentionable relative kept in unsuspected confinement?

DIRECTION:
She stops beside the staircase, staring upward into shadows. Her mind races.

NARRATOR:
I can’t say how long I turned it over, or how long, in a confusion of curiosity and dread, I remained where I had had my collision; I only recall that when I re-entered the house darkness had quite closed in.

DIRECTION:
She moves slowly into the drawing room. The light from a single lamp flickers.

NARRATOR:
Agitation, in the interval, certainly had held me and driven me, for I must, in circling about the place, have walked three miles; but I was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill.

DIRECTION:
She sinks into a chair. Her breathing slows, but her eyes remain alert, haunted.

NARRATOR:
The most singular part of it, in fact—singular as the rest had been—was the part I became, in the hall, aware of in meeting Mrs. Grose.

DIRECTION:
MRS. GROSE enters, surprised and visibly relieved.

NARRATOR:
This picture comes back to me in the general train—the impression, as I received it on my return, of the wide white panelled space, bright in the lamplight and with its portraits and red carpet, and of the good surprised look of my friend, which immediately told me she had missed me.

DIRECTION:
MRS. GROSE touches her arm, gently. The GOVERNESS smiles faintly, guarded.

NARRATOR:
It came to me straightway, under her contact, that, with plain heartiness, mere relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing whatever that could bear upon the incident I had there ready for her.

DIRECTION:
A pause. The GOVERNESS lowers her eyes.

NARRATOR:
I had not suspected in advance that her comfortable face would pull me up, and I somehow measured the importance of what I had seen by my thus finding myself hesitate to mention it.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS looks back up, conflicted.

NARRATOR:
Scarce anything in the whole history seems to me so odd as this fact that my real beginning of fear was one, as I may say, with the instinct of sparing my companion.

DIRECTION:
She forces a polite smile and gives a small excuse.

NARRATOR:
On the spot, accordingly, in the pleasant hall and with her eyes on me, I, for a reason that I couldn’t then have phrased, achieved an inward resolution—offered a vague pretext for my lateness and, with the plea of the beauty of the night and of the heavy dew and wet feet, went as soon as possible to my room.

DIRECTION:
She withdraws, gently, moving upstairs with slow, deliberate steps. MRS. GROSE watches her go, puzzled.

NARRATOR:
Here it was another affair; here, for many days after, it was a queer affair enough.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS sits at her dressing table. Her reflection in the mirror looks back, pale and restless.

NARRATOR:
There were hours, from day to day—or at least there were moments, snatched even from clear duties—when I had to shut myself up to think.

DIRECTION:
She closes the door, locking it. The lamp light glows dimly.

NARRATOR:
It was not so much yet that I was more nervous than I could bear to be as that I was remarkably afraid of becoming so; for the truth I had now to turn over was, simply and clearly, the truth that I could arrive at no account whatever of the visitor with whom I had been so inexplicably and yet, as it seemed to me, so intimately concerned.

DIRECTION:
She picks up her journal, hesitates, then puts it down. Her mind reels.

NARRATOR:
It took little time to see that I could sound without forms of inquiry and without exciting remark any domestic complications.

DIRECTION:
She passes quietly among the staff, watching, listening—but hearing nothing.

NARRATOR:
The shock I had suffered must have sharpened all my senses; I felt sure, at the end of three days and as the result of mere closer attention, that I had not been practiced upon by the servants nor made the object of any "game."

DIRECTION:
She listens at doors. She inspects windows. There is nothing.

NARRATOR:
Of whatever it was that I knew, nothing was known around me. There was but one sane inference: someone had taken a liberty rather gross.

DIRECTION:
Her face hardens. She whispers to herself.

NARRATOR:
That was what, repeatedly, I dipped into my room and locked the door to say to myself.

DIRECTION:
She bolts the door once more. The shadows stretch longer.

BLACKOUT.



















CHAPTER 5::

NARRATOR:
Oh, she let me know as soon as, round the corner of the house, she loomed again into view. "What in the name of goodness is the matter—?"

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose approaches in a state of concern and worry, trying to understand the Governess’s state.

GOVERNESS:
(Mustering some control, her face betrays her feelings)
With me? Do I show it?

MRS. GROSE:
(Surprised and worried, taking in the Governess’s appearance)
You're as white as a sheet. You look awful.

DIRECTION:
The Governess's distress is palpable, her physical appearance showing the weight of what she’s been through.

GOVERNESS:
(Pauses to compose herself, then speaks softly, trying to hide her fear)
I considered; I could meet on this, without scruple, any innocence.

DIRECTION:
The Governess tries to hide her emotions but is clearly shaken. She hesitates before answering.

GOVERNESS:
(Trying to sound calm)
You came for me for church, of course, but I can't go.

MRS. GROSE:
(Softly, still concerned)
Has anything happened?

GOVERNESS:
(Nods slowly, finally admitting the fear inside)
Yes. You must know now. Did I look very queer?

MRS. GROSE:
(Nodding, recalling the strange encounter)
Through this window? Dreadful!

GOVERNESS:
(Almost whispering, now fully admitting the truth)
Well, I've been frightened.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose seems genuinely concerned, her reaction to the Governess’s admission showing that she too feels the weight of the unknown.

MRS. GROSE:
(Eyes wide with concern)
What was it?

GOVERNESS:
(Clutching her hands, looking around nervously)
An extraordinary man. Looking in.

MRS. GROSE:
(Confused, trying to make sense of it)
What extraordinary man?

GOVERNESS:
(Growing more frantic)
I haven't the least idea.

DIRECTION:
The Governess's thoughts are racing, unable to comprehend or explain what happened.

MRS. GROSE:
(She searches around, still not understanding)
Then where is he gone?

GOVERNESS:
(Almost in disbelief)
I know still less.

MRS. GROSE:
(Turning slowly, trying to process)
Have you seen him before?

GOVERNESS:
(Remembering the past encounter)
Yes—once. On the old tower.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose stares in utter disbelief, trying to comprehend the Governess's account.

MRS. GROSE:
(Trying to grasp the situation, even more confused)
Do you mean he's a stranger?

GOVERNESS:
(With a sense of finality, certain in her response)
Oh, very much!

MRS. GROSE:
(Shocked, she reacts instinctively)
Yet you didn't tell me?

GOVERNESS:
(Nods, now feeling the weight of her own secrecy)
No—for reasons. But now that you've guessed—

MRS. GROSE:
(Eyes full of surprise and confusion, pausing)
Ah, I haven't guessed!

GOVERNESS:
(Explaining, trying to make sense of what she’s feeling)
How can I if YOU don't imagine?

MRS. GROSE:
(Trying to help make sense of it, still confused)
I don't in the very least.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose is trying to piece together the fragments of the Governess's words.

MRS. GROSE:
(Looking around again, still processing)
You've seen him nowhere but on the tower?

GOVERNESS:
(Nods slowly)
And on this spot just now.

MRS. GROSE:
(With more urgency, trying to understand)
What was he doing on the tower?

GOVERNESS:
(Pausing, trying to make sense of her fear)
Only standing there and looking down at me.

DIRECTION:
The Governess speaks with a shudder, remembering the exact position and the intensity of the encounter.

MRS. GROSE:
(After a moment of thought, her concern growing)
Was he a gentleman?

GOVERNESS:
(With clarity now, shaking her head)
No.

MRS. GROSE:
(Incredulously)
Then nobody about the place? Nobody from the village?

GOVERNESS:
(With finality, looking her in the eyes)
Nobody—nobody. I didn't tell you, but I made sure.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose is struck by the finality of the Governess’s certainty.

MRS. GROSE:
(With a soft sigh of relief, but still perplexed)
But if he isn't a gentleman—

GOVERNESS:
(With mounting dread)
What IS he? He's a horror.

MRS. GROSE:
(Shocked, almost disbelieving)
A horror?

GOVERNESS:
(With great emotion, shaking her head as she speaks)
He's—God help me if I know WHAT he is!

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose and the Governess exchange a deep, understanding gaze. The fear is mutual, but the mystery deepens.

MRS. GROSE:
(Looking around the room again, pulling herself together)
It's time we should be at church.

GOVERNESS:
(Distraught, refusing to go)
Oh, I'm not fit for church!

MRS. GROSE:
(Gently trying to convince her)
Won't it do you good?

GOVERNESS:
(With determination)
It won't do THEM—!

DIRECTION:
The Governess gestures toward the house, indicating her fear for the children.

MRS. GROSE:
(With understanding, nods)
The children?

GOVERNESS:
(Speaking boldly, with finality)
I'm afraid of HIM.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose reacts, the idea taking root in her mind. She is beginning to understand the gravity of the situation.

MRS. GROSE:
(Her face reflects a dawning realization, looking distant for a moment)
Do you fear for them?

DIRECTION:
The Governess and Mrs. Grose exchange a long, heavy look, the tension mounting.

GOVERNESS:
(With a final, grim statement)
Don't YOU?

DIRECTION:
The Governess’s words hang in the air as Mrs. Grose approaches the window, her thoughts clearly in turmoil.

MRS. GROSE:
(After a moment, looking out the window)
You see how he could see.

GOVERNESS:
(Stepping closer, speaking urgently)
How long was he here?

MRS. GROSE:
(With slow, deliberate words)
Till I came out. I came to meet him.

DIRECTION:
The Governess pauses for a moment, considering this, before speaking again.

MRS. GROSE:
(Turning, with deep concern now etched on her face)
I couldn't have come out.

GOVERNESS:
(Laughs nervously, trying to make light of the situation)
Neither could I! But I did come. I have my duty.

MRS. GROSE:
(With a serious expression, but acknowledging the Governess's resolve)
So have I mine.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose turns and, after a moment, asks the key question, her expression filled with uncertainty.

MRS. GROSE:
(Gently)
What is he like?

GOVERNESS:
(With deep emotion, finally describing him in full)
I've been dying to tell you. But he's like nobody.

MRS. GROSE:
(Shocked, confused)
Nobody?

GOVERNESS:
(Nods, then quickly adds more details as she recounts the appearance of the stranger)
He has no hat. Very red, close-curling hair. Pale face, long in shape, with straight features and little, rather queer whiskers that are as red as his hair. His eyebrows are darker—arched and sharp. His eyes are small, strange... awfully fixed. His mouth is wide, his lips thin.

DIRECTION:
The Governess describes the stranger in vivid detail, and Mrs. Grose listens in shocked silence.

GOVERNESS:
(With certainty)
He's tall, active, erect—but never—no, never!—a gentleman.

MRS. GROSE:
(In disbelief)
A gentleman? A gentleman HE?

GOVERNESS:
(With finality)
No.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose’s face whitens as the shock sets in. Her disbelief begins to shift into horror.

MRS. GROSE:
(Stammering)
You know him, then?

GOVERNESS:
(With grim realization)
You DO know him?

MRS. GROSE:
(After a long pause, her face a mixture of confusion and recognition)
Quint!

GOVERNESS:
(Shocked)
Quint?

MRS. GROSE:
(With a faint, terrified understanding)
Peter Quint—his own man, his valet, when he was here!

GOVERNESS:
(Stunned by the revelation)
When the master was?

MRS. GROSE:
(Nodding, confirming the truth)
He never wore his hat, but he did wear—well, there were waistcoats missed. They were both here—last year. Then the master went, and Quint was alone.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose’s words hit the Governess like a thunderclap. The full weight of the revelation dawns on her.






















CHAPTER 6::

NARRATOR:
It took of course more than that particular passage to place us together in presence of what we had now to live with as we could—my dreadful liability to impressions of the order so vividly exemplified, and my companion's knowledge, henceforth—a knowledge half consternation and half compassion—of that liability.

DIRECTION:
The Governess reflects deeply on her emotional state and the bond with Mrs. Grose. Both have been marked by the mysterious occurrences at Bly.

NARRATOR:
There had been, this evening, after the revelation left me, for an hour, so prostrate—there had been, for either of us, no attendance on any service but a little service of tears and vows, of prayers and promises, a climax to the series of mutual challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our retreating together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there to have everything out.

DIRECTION:
The Governess and Mrs. Grose retreat to the schoolroom to confront the truth. The room becomes a sanctuary for their private struggle.

NARRATOR:
The result of our having everything out was simply to reduce our situation to the last rigor of its elements. She herself had seen nothing, not the shadow of a shadow, and nobody in the house but the governess was in the governess's plight; yet she accepted without directly impugning my sanity the truth as I gave it to her, and ended by showing me, on this ground, an awestricken tenderness, an expression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege, of which the very breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of human charities.

DIRECTION:
The Governess speaks with a heavy heart, but there is relief in the fact that Mrs. Grose supports her, even if only emotionally. The connection between them deepens.

NARRATOR:
What was settled between us, accordingly, that night, was that we thought we might bear things together; and I was not even sure that, in spite of her exemption, it was she who had the best of the burden.

DIRECTION:
The Governess and Mrs. Grose come to an unspoken agreement, a joint resolution to face the strange occurrences, even if the burden is heavy.

NARRATOR:
I knew at this hour, I think, as well as I knew later, what I was capable of meeting to shelter my pupils; but it took me some time to be wholly sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so compromising a contract.

DIRECTION:
The Governess reflects on her own resolve and the complicated nature of her role. Her thoughts are filled with duty and concern for the children.

NARRATOR:
I was queer company enough—quite as queer as the company I received; but as I trace over what we went through I see how much common ground we must have found in the one idea that, by good fortune, COULD steady us.

DIRECTION:
The Governess acknowledges her inner conflict, but finds solace in the idea that they must rely on each other, as well as their mutual purpose to protect the children.

NARRATOR:
It was the idea, the second movement, that led me straight out, as I may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. I could take the air in the court, at least, and there Mrs. Grose could join me.

DIRECTION:
The Governess decides to take a breath, finding brief solace in the outdoors, and invites Mrs. Grose to join her, as they both seek a sense of calm.

NARRATOR:
Perfectly can I recall now the particular way strength came to me before we separated for the night. We had gone over and over every feature of what I had seen.

DIRECTION:
The Governess and Mrs. Grose reflect deeply on the events of the day. The Governess’s courage begins to surface as she finds strength in her resolve.

GOVERNESS:
He was looking for someone else, you say—someone who was not you?

DIRECTION:
The Governess speaks with certainty, now fully comprehending what happened, but still wrestling with fear.

NARRATOR:
"That's whom he was looking for."

DIRECTION:
The Governess speaks with a newfound clarity that reflects her growing understanding of the situation.

MRS. GROSE:
But how do you know?

GOVERNESS:
I know, I know, I know! My exaltation grew.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose listens, still trying to grasp the enormity of what the Governess is saying.

NARRATOR:
She didn't deny this, but I required, I felt, not even so much telling as that. She resumed in a moment, at any rate: "What if HE should see him?"

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose is still unsure, but the Governess continues with clear conviction.

GOVERNESS:
Little Miles? That's what he wants!

MRS. GROSE:
The child?

GOVERNESS:
Heaven forbid! The man. He wants to appear to THEM.

DIRECTION:
The realization hits Mrs. Grose hard, and her fear intensifies. The Governess steels herself to protect the children.

NARRATOR:
That he might was an awful conception, and yet, somehow, I could keep it at bay; which, moreover, as we lingered there, was what I succeeded in practically proving.

DIRECTION:
The Governess's determination grows, as she feels that by facing the horror, she can protect the children.

NARRATOR:
I had an absolute certainty that I should see again what I had already seen, but something within me said that by offering myself bravely as the sole subject of such experience, by accepting, by inviting, by surmounting it all, I should serve as an expiatory victim and guard the tranquility of my companions.

DIRECTION:
The Governess prepares herself for further confrontation, willing to sacrifice her own peace for the sake of the children’s safety.

NARRATOR:
The children, in especial, I should thus fence about and absolutely save.

DIRECTION:
The Governess reflects on the importance of her role—she feels responsible for the children's safety above all else.

NARRATOR:
I recall one of the last things I said that night to Mrs. Grose.

DIRECTION:
The Governess speaks, trying to clarify her thoughts and finalize the plan.

GOVERNESS:
It does strike me that my pupils have never mentioned—

MRS. GROSE:
His having been here and the time they were with him?

GOVERNESS:
The time they were with him, and his name, his presence, his history, in any way.

MRS. GROSE:
Oh, the little lady doesn't remember. She never heard or knew.

GOVERNESS:
The circumstances of his death? Perhaps not. But Miles would remember—Miles would know.

MRS. GROSE:
Ah, don't try him!

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose is clearly disturbed, but the Governess presses on with her questions.

NARRATOR:
I returned her the look she had given me. "Don't be afraid." I continued to think. "It IS rather odd."

DIRECTION:
The Governess gives Mrs. Grose a comforting look but continues to be disturbed by the mystery.

MRS. GROSE:
That he has never spoken of him?

GOVERNESS:
Never by the least allusion. And you tell me they were 'great friends'?

MRS. GROSE:
Oh, it wasn't HIM! It was Quint's own fancy. To play with him, I mean—to spoil him.

DIRECTION:
The Governess is shocked and deeply disgusted by the idea of Quint’s influence.

GOVERNESS:
Too free with MY boy?

MRS. GROSE:
Too free with everyone!

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose is overcome with emotion as the Governess grapples with the horror of the situation.

CHAPTER 1::

\[...existing content remains unchanged...]

CHAPTER 7::

NARRATOR:
I got hold of Mrs. Grose as soon after this as I could; and I can give no intelligible account of how I fought out the interval. Yet I still hear myself cry as I fairly threw myself into her arms: "They KNOW—it's too monstrous: they know, they know!"

DIRECTION:
The Governess, overcome with emotion, reaches out to Mrs. Grose in her distress, struggling to comprehend the horror of the situation.

MRS. GROSE:
(Stunned, holding the Governess with a mix of confusion and concern)
And what on earth—?

GOVERNESS:
(Trying to compose herself, yet visibly shaken)
Why, all that WE know—and heaven knows what else besides!

DIRECTION:
The Governess is desperate to convey the depth of her fear, but her words are disjointed, reflecting her inner turmoil.

GOVERNESS:
(Takes a breath, struggling to make sense of it all)
Two hours ago, in the garden—Flora SAW!

DIRECTION:
The Governess speaks with growing urgency, her mind racing as she reveals the unsettling truth to Mrs. Grose.

MRS. GROSE:
(Gasping in shock, unable to fully comprehend)
She has told you?

GOVERNESS:
(Shaking her head, unable to hide her growing frustration)
Not a word—that's the horror. She kept it to herself! The child of eight, THAT child!

DIRECTION:
The Governess is stunned by the child’s secrecy, her disbelief evident as she tries to process the implications.

MRS. GROSE:
(Wide-eyed, deeply confused and overwhelmed)
Then how do you know?

GOVERNESS:
(Solemn, speaking with conviction)
I was there—I saw with my eyes: saw that she was perfectly aware.

DIRECTION:
The Governess speaks with certainty, despite the confusion she feels inside. Mrs. Grose is now processing the shock.

MRS. GROSE:
(Eyes wide, struggling to keep up)
Do you mean aware of HIM?

GOVERNESS:
(With deep conviction, shaking her head)
No—of HER.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose is in utter disbelief as the Governess speaks of an even greater terror.

GOVERNESS:
(With growing clarity and fear)
Another person—this time; but a figure of quite as unmistakable horror and evil: a woman in black, pale and dreadful—with such an air also, and such a face!—on the other side of the lake. I was there with the child—quiet for the hour; and in the midst of it she came.

DIRECTION:
The Governess is overcome by the vivid memory, and her emotion heightens as she describes the ghostly woman.

MRS. GROSE:
(Trying to understand, her voice trembles)
Came how—from where?

GOVERNESS:
(With intensity, her voice low and fearful)
From where they come from! She just appeared and stood there—but not so near.

DIRECTION:
The Governess describes the apparition, still shaken, as she relives the moment of terror.

MRS. GROSE:
(Eyes darting, looking for an answer)
And without coming nearer?

GOVERNESS:
(Fear creeping into her voice)
Oh, for the effect and the feeling, she might have been as close as you!

DIRECTION:
The Governess speaks with intensity, remembering the fearful proximity of the figure, but also the chilling distance.

MRS. GROSE:
(A step back, unsure)
Was she someone you've never seen?

GOVERNESS:
(With certainty, her fear palpable)
Yes. But someone the child has. Someone YOU have.

DIRECTION:
The Governess’s words hit Mrs. Grose like a blow, and the reality of what has happened begins to sink in.

GOVERNESS:
(As if making a final, disturbing realization)
My predecessor—the one who died.

MRS. GROSE:
(With a soft gasp, recognition dawning)
Miss Jessel?

GOVERNESS:
(Almost pleading, hoping for confirmation)
Miss Jessel. You don't believe me?

MRS. GROSE:
(Shaken, unable to believe it, she hesitates)
How can you be sure?

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose is visibly distressed, unsure, but trying to make sense of the Governess’s revelations.

GOVERNESS:
(A flash of impatience, but clarity in her voice)
Then ask Flora—SHE'S sure!

DIRECTION:
The Governess is frustrated and urgent, but she immediately catches herself, realizing the danger of involving Flora.

GOVERNESS:
(With great emotion, her voice breaking)
No, for God's sake, DON'T! She'll say she isn't—she'll lie!

MRS. GROSE:
(Confused, but still deeply concerned)
Ah, how CAN you?

DIRECTION:
The Governess is unraveling, but Mrs. Grose is still trying to hold onto the situation, her own confusion evident.

GOVERNESS:
(Trying to calm herself, but her fear is growing)
Because I'm clear. Flora doesn't want me to know.

MRS. GROSE:
(Gently, trying to explain away the fear)
It's only then to spare you.

GOVERNESS:
(Fighting back the tears, more certain than ever)
No, no—there are depths, depths! The more I go over it, the more I see in it, and the more I see in it, the more I fear. I don't know what I DON'T see—what I DON'T fear!

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose can only stand by, deeply disturbed by the Governess’s words, but unable to fully comprehend the depths of the situation.

MRS. GROSE:
(Trying to steady the Governess)
You mean you're afraid of seeing her again?

GOVERNESS:
(With a breath of resolve, then shaking her head)
Oh, no; that's nothing—now!

DIRECTION:
The Governess's fear of facing the unknown persists, but she is more resolute than ever to protect the children.

GOVERNESS:
(Revealing her deeper fear, voice trembling)
It's of NOT seeing her.

DIRECTION:
The Governess’s horror is now palpable—her greatest fear is not the ghost, but the possibility that it will return.

MRS. GROSE:
(Her face turns pale, clearly frightened, as she listens to the Governess's distress)
I don't understand you.

GOVERNESS:
(With urgency)
Why, it's that the child may keep it up—and that the child assuredly WILL—without my knowing it.

DIRECTION:
The Governess’s determination is now stronger—she will not let this force control the children any longer.

MRS. GROSE:
(In disbelief, trembling at the implications of the Governess’s words)
Do you fear for them?

DIRECTION:
The Governess looks deeply into Mrs. Grose's eyes, both of them now bound by the unspoken realization of what is at stake.

GOVERNESS:
(With a finality that leaves no doubt in the air)
Don't YOU?

DIRECTION:
The Governess’s words are heavy, and Mrs. Grose stares into the distance, contemplating the full horror of what has been revealed.

























CHAPTER 8::

NARRATOR:
What I had said to Mrs. Grose was true enough: there were in the matter I had put before her depths and possibilities that I lacked resolution to sound; so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of a common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant fancies. We were to keep our heads if we should keep nothing else—difficult indeed as that might be in the face of what, in our prodigious experience, was least to be questioned.

DIRECTION:
The Governess and Mrs. Grose are determined to keep their composure, facing the unsettling events with resolve and mutual support.

NARRATOR:
Late that night, while the house slept, we had another talk in my room, when she went all the way with me as to its being beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen.

DIRECTION:
The Governess and Mrs. Grose converse in the stillness of the night, their intensity growing as they confront the reality of the situation.

GOVERNESS:
To hold her perfectly in the pinch of that, I found I had only to ask her how, if I had "made it up," I came to be able to give, of each of the persons appearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their special marks—a portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly recognized and named them.

DIRECTION:
The Governess uses logical reasoning to confirm her vision, and Mrs. Grose’s recognition of the figures strengthens her case.

GOVERNESS:
She wished of course—small blame to her!—to sink the whole subject; and I was quick to assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a search for the way to escape from it.

DIRECTION:
The Governess seeks closure and a way to move forward, yet Mrs. Grose remains deeply concerned.

NARRATOR:
On leaving her, after my first outbreak, I had of course returned to my pupils, associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of their charm which I had already found to be a thing I could positively cultivate and which had never failed me yet.

DIRECTION:
The Governess, seeking comfort in the children, returns to them for a sense of normalcy.

NARRATOR:
I had simply, in other words, plunged afresh into Flora's special society and there become aware—it was almost a luxury!—that she could put her little conscious hand straight upon the spot that ached.

DIRECTION:
The Governess finds solace in Flora’s company, momentarily easing her tension and concern.

NARRATOR:
She had looked at me in sweet speculation and then had accused me to my face of having "cried."

DIRECTION:
Flora observes the Governess with innocence, unaware of the turmoil the Governess is experiencing.

NARRATOR:
I had supposed I had brushed away the ugly signs: but I could literally—for the time, at all events—rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that they had not entirely disappeared.

DIRECTION:
The Governess reflects on Flora's kindness, finding comfort in her innocence.

NARRATOR:
To gaze into the depths of blue of the child's eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which I naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and, so far as might be, my agitation.

DIRECTION:
The Governess is overwhelmed by Flora’s beauty and innocence, which leads her to reconsider her suspicions.

NARRATOR:
I couldn't abjure for merely wanting to, but I could repeat to Mrs. Grose—as I did there, over and over, in the small hours—that with their voices in the air, their pressure on one's heart, and their fragrant faces against one's cheek, everything fell to the ground but their incapacity and their beauty.

DIRECTION:
The Governess becomes more convinced of the children’s innocence as she reflects on their loveliness and purity.

NARRATOR:
It was a pity that, somehow, to settle this once for all, I had equally to re-enumerate the signs of subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake had made a miracle of my show of self-possession.

DIRECTION:
The Governess remains uncertain, haunted by the events by the lake, and feels compelled to revisit them.

NARRATOR:
It was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate the certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as a revelation that the inconceivable communion I then surprised was a matter, for either party, of habit.

DIRECTION:
The Governess feels compelled to analyze the situation, seeking to understand the revelations and their implications.

NARRATOR:
It was a pity that I should have had to quaver out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion, so much as questioned that the little girl saw our visitant even as I actually saw Mrs. Grose herself, and that she wanted, by just so much as she did thus see, to make me suppose she didn't, and at the same time, without showing anything, arrive at a guess as to whether I myself did!

DIRECTION:
The Governess is troubled, questioning why Flora acted in such a way, and wondering about her own delusion.

NARRATOR:
It was a pity that I needed once more to describe the portentous little activity by which she sought to divert my attention—the perceptible increase of movement, the greater intensity of play, the singing, the gabbling of nonsense, and the invitation to romp.

DIRECTION:
The Governess recalls how Flora attempted to distract her, intensifying her suspicion about the child’s behavior.

NARRATOR:
Yet if I had not indulged, to prove there was nothing in it, in this review, I should have missed the two or three dim elements of comfort that still remained to me.

DIRECTION:
Despite her suspicions, the Governess reflects on the comfort she finds in the children’s presence.

NARRATOR:
I should not for instance have been able to asseverate to my friend that I was certain—which was so much to the good—that I at least had not betrayed myself.

DIRECTION:
The Governess feels relieved, knowing that she has kept control of the situation, and hasn't revealed her true thoughts to Mrs. Grose.

NARRATOR:
I should not have been prompted, by stress of need, by desperation of mind—I scarce know what to call it—to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring from pushing my colleague fairly to the wall.

DIRECTION:
In her desperation, the Governess presses Mrs. Grose for more information, hoping to find the answers she needs.

NARRATOR:
She had told me, bit by bit, under pressure, a great deal; but a small shifty spot on the wrong side of it all still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat; and I remember how on this occasion—for the sleeping house and the concentration alike of our danger and our watch seemed to help—I felt the importance of giving the last jerk to the curtain.

NARRATOR:
"I don't believe anything so horrible," I recollect saying; "no, let us put it definitely, my dear, that I don't. But if I did, you know, there's a thing I should require now, just without sparing you the least bit more—oh, not a scrap, come!—to get out of you. What was it you had in mind when, in our distress, before Miles came back, over the letter from his school, you said, under my insistence, that you didn't pretend for him that he had not literally EVER been 'bad'? He has NOT literally 'ever,' in these weeks that I myself have lived with him and so closely watched him; he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful, lovable goodness."

DIRECTION:
The Governess now questions Mrs. Grose about the boy's past, pressing her to reveal the truth.


























CHAPTER 9::

NARRATOR:
I waited and waited, and the days, as they elapsed, took something from my consternation. A very few of them, in fact, passing, in constant sight of my pupils, without a fresh incident, sufficed to give to grievous fancies and even to odious memories a kind of brush of the sponge. I have spoken of the surrender to their extraordinary childish grace as a thing I could actively cultivate, and it may be imagined if I neglected now to address myself to this source for whatever it would yield.

DIRECTION:
The Governess reflects on her growing attachment to the children, yet struggles with the lingering fear and uncertainty from the previous events.

NARRATOR:
Stranger than I can express, certainly, was the effort to struggle against my new lights; it would doubtless have been, however, a greater tension still had it not been so frequently successful. I used to wonder how my little charges could help guessing that I thought strange things about them; and the circumstances that these things only made them more interesting was not by itself a direct aid to keeping them in the dark.

DIRECTION:
The Governess tries to fight the tension, caught between her suspicion and affection for the children.

NARRATOR:
They were at this period extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me; which, after all, I could reflect, was no more than a graceful response in children perpetually bowed over and hugged. The homage of which they were so lavish succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if I never appeared to myself, as I may say, literally to catch them at a purpose in it.

DIRECTION:
Flora and Miles show extraordinary affection for the Governess, but she remains wary of the depths behind their behavior.

NARRATOR:
What surpassed everything was that there was a little boy in the world who could have for the inferior age, sex, and intelligence so fine a consideration. They were extraordinarily at one, and to say that they never either quarreled or complained is to make the note of praise coarse for their quality of sweetness.

DIRECTION:
The Governess is taken aback by the children's bond, their closeness and adoration for each other, which deepens her mistrust.

NARRATOR:
I find that I really hang back; but I must take my plunge. In going on with the record of what was hideous at Bly, I not only challenge the most liberal faith—for which I little care; but—and this is another matter—I renew what I myself suffered, I again push my way through it to the end.

DIRECTION:
The Governess steels herself to continue the narrative, knowing that her next steps will bring more painful revelations.

NARRATOR:
There came suddenly an hour after which, as I look back, the affair seems to me to have been all pure suffering; but I have at least reached the heart of it, and the straightest road out is doubtless to advance. One evening—with nothing to lead up or to prepare it—I felt the cold touch of the impression that had breathed on me the night of my arrival and which, much lighter then, as I have mentioned, I should probably have made little of in memory had my subsequent sojourn been less agitated.

DIRECTION:
The Governess recalls the chilling sensation that first gripped her upon arrival at Bly, and realizes that the fear has only grown stronger.

NARRATOR:
I had not gone to bed; I sat reading by a couple of candles. There was a roomful of old books at Bly—last century fiction, some of it, which, to the extent of a distinctly deprecated renown, but never to so much as that of a stray specimen, had reached the sequestered home and appealed to the unavowed curiosity of my youth. I remember that the book I had in my hand was Fielding's Amelia; also that I was wholly awake.

DIRECTION:
The Governess reflects on her solitude and discomfort while reading. The sense of foreboding continues to grow.

NARRATOR:
I recall further both a general conviction that it was horribly late and a particular objection to looking at my watch. I figure, finally, that the white curtain draping, in the fashion of those days, the head of Flora's little bed, shrouded, as I had assured myself long before, the perfection of childish rest.

DIRECTION:
The Governess notices Flora's peaceful slumber, yet unease stirs within her.

NARRATOR:
I recollect in short that, though I was deeply interested in my author, I found myself, at the turn of a page and with his spell all scattered, looking straight up from him and hard at the door of my room.

DIRECTION:
A shift in focus occurs as the Governess becomes aware of the unnatural presence around her.

NARRATOR:
There was a moment during which I listened, reminded of the faint sense I had had, the first night, of there being something undefinably astir in the house, and noted the soft breath of the open casement just move the half-drawn blind.

DIRECTION:
A sense of unease pervades the scene as the Governess listens for signs of intrusion.

NARRATOR:
Then, with all the marks of a deliberation that must have seemed magnificent had there been anyone to admire it, I laid down my book, rose to my feet, and, taking a candle, went straight out of the room and, from the passage, on which my light made little impression, noiselessly closed and locked the door.

DIRECTION:
The Governess takes action, determined to investigate the eerie presence.

NARRATOR:
I can say now neither what determined nor what guided me, but I went straight along the lobby, holding my candle high, till I came within sight of the tall window that presided over the great turn of the staircase. At this point I precipitately found myself aware of three things. They were practically simultaneous, yet they had flashes of succession.

DIRECTION:
Suspense builds as the Governess approaches the staircase, sensing something ominous.

NARRATOR:
My candle, under a bold flourish, went out, and I perceived, by the uncovered window, that the yielding dusk of earliest morning rendered it unnecessary. Without it, the next instant, I saw that there was someone on the stair. I speak of sequences, but I required no lapse of seconds to stiffen myself for a third encounter with Quint.

DIRECTION:
A confrontation unfolds as the Governess faces the apparition once again, this time in the early morning hours.

NARRATOR:
The apparition had reached the landing halfway up and was therefore on the spot nearest the window, where at sight of me, it stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower and from the garden. He knew me as well as I knew him; and so, in the cold, faint twilight, with a glimmer in the high glass and another on the polish of the oak stair below, we faced each other in our common intensity.

DIRECTION:
The Governess and Quint lock eyes, their shared intensity building to a climactic moment.

NARRATOR:
He was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable, dangerous presence. But that was not the wonder of wonders; I reserve this distinction for quite another circumstance: the circumstance that dread had unmistakably quitted me and that there was nothing in me there that didn't meet and measure him.

DIRECTION:
The Governess confronts the evil presence without fear, her strength now matched by his malevolence.

NARRATOR:
I had plenty of anguish after that extraordinary moment, but I had, thank God, no terror. And he knew I had not—I found myself at the end of an instant magnificently aware of this.

DIRECTION:
The Governess experiences relief despite the overwhelming presence of Quint, confident in her strength.




























CHAPTER 10::

NARRATOR:
I remained awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect presently of understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone: then I returned to my room. The foremost thing I saw there by the light of the candle I had left burning was that Flora's little bed was empty; and on this I caught my breath with all the terror that, five minutes before, I had been able to resist.

DIRECTION:
The Governess returns to her room to find Flora's bed empty, triggering a moment of panic and fear.

NARRATOR:
I dashed at the place in which I had left her lying and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were disarranged) the white curtains had been deceivingly pulled forward; then my step, to my unutterable relief, produced an answering sound: I perceived an agitation of the window blind, and the child, ducking down, emerged rosily from the other side of it.

DIRECTION:
The Governess is relieved when Flora reappears, yet the suspense remains as Flora acts in a peculiar and mysterious way.

NARRATOR:
She stood there in so much of her candor and so little of her nightgown, with her pink bare feet and the golden glow of her curls. She looked intensely grave, and I had never had such a sense of losing an advantage acquired (the thrill of which had just been so prodigious) as on my consciousness that she addressed me with a reproach.

DIRECTION:
Flora appears innocent, but the Governess feels something strange in the way she speaks.

NARRATOR:
"You naughty: where HAVE you been?"—instead of challenging her own irregularity I found myself arraigned and explaining. She herself explained, for that matter, with the loveliest, eagerest simplicity. She had known suddenly, as she lay there, that I was out of the room, and had jumped up to see what had become of me.

DIRECTION:
Flora responds with a childlike innocence that disarms the Governess's suspicions, yet the Governess remains uneasy.

NARRATOR:
I had dropped, with the joy of her reappearance, back into my chair—feeling then, and then only, a little faint; and she had pattered straight over to me, thrown herself upon my knee, given herself to be held with the flame of the candle full in the wonderful little face that was still flushed with sleep.

DIRECTION:
Flora is endearing, and the Governess finds herself caught between her affection and fear.

NARRATOR:
I remember closing my eyes an instant, yieldingly, consciously, as before the excess of something beautiful that shone out of the blue of her own. "You were looking for me out of the window?" I said. "You thought I might be walking in the grounds?"

DIRECTION:
The Governess asks Flora about the earlier strange behavior, trying to make sense of the situation.

NARRATOR:
"Well, you know, I thought someone was"—she never blanched as she smiled out that at me.

DIRECTION:
Flora smiles with a mysterious innocence that only deepens the Governess's suspicions.

NARRATOR:
At that moment, in the state of my nerves, I absolutely believed she lied; and if I once more closed my eyes it was before the dazzle of the three or four possible ways in which I might take this up.

DIRECTION:
The Governess grapples with her growing suspicion of Flora, torn between trust and doubt.

NARRATOR:
One of these, for a moment, tempted me with such singular intensity that, to withstand it, I must have gripped my little girl with a spasm that, wonderfully, she submitted to without a cry or a sign of fright.

DIRECTION:
The Governess almost succumbs to her fear and the temptation to confront Flora directly.

NARRATOR:
Why not break out at her on the spot and have it all over?—give it to her straight in her lovely little lighted face? "You see, you see, you KNOW that you do and that you already quite suspect I believe it; therefore, why not frankly confess it to me, so that we may at least live with it together and learn perhaps, in the strangeness of our fate, where we are and what it means?"

DIRECTION:
The Governess debates whether to confront Flora with her suspicions directly.

NARRATOR:
This solicitation dropped, alas, as it came: if I could immediately have succumbed to it I might have spared myself—well, you'll see what. Instead of succumbing I sprang again to my feet, looked at her bed, and took a helpless middle way. "Why did you pull the curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?"

DIRECTION:
The Governess tries to get answers, but Flora's responses only deepen the mystery.

NARRATOR:
Flora luminously considered; after which, with her little divine smile: "Because I don't like to frighten you!"

DIRECTION:
Flora's innocent smile and explanation add to the tension and uncertainty.

NARRATOR:
"But if I had, by your idea, gone out—?" She absolutely declined to be puzzled; she turned her eyes to the flame of the candle as if the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate as impersonal, as Mrs. Marcet or nine-times-nine. "Oh, but you know," she quite adequately answered, "that you might come back, you dear, and that you HAVE!"

DIRECTION:
Flora deflects the Governess's questioning with a childish innocence that seems to hide something.

NARRATOR:
I had thought of all this before; but my little girl was somehow the more awful for being exactly what she was. To the other things I could cling, but there were things, things that came to me from the past, that should never have been allowed to cloud the future. And if I didn’t make the choice that time, I’m not sure what would have happened.

DIRECTION:
Flora's innocence seems impenetrable, and the Governess feels herself compelled to act.

* Chapter 10 focuses on the Governess’s suspicion of Flora after her strange behavior, especially in relation to the ghostly apparitions.
* The Governess experiences inner conflict, unsure whether to confront Flora about what she suspects, but also unsure whether her fears are just overactive imagination.

CHAPTER 11

NARRATOR:
It was not until late the next day that I spoke to Mrs. Grose. My constant vigilance over the children made private conversation difficult, and we both knew the importance of avoiding any suspicion among the servants—or the children—that we might be discussing hidden matters.

I found solace in Mrs. Grose’s calm exterior. She believed me—of that I was sure—and I couldn’t have endured the weight of these horrors without her. Yet, she remained a monument to the blessing of a limited imagination. If the children had shown any visible damage, I’m sure she would have unraveled. But as it was, they looked radiant; and so she turned all concern to me.

NARRATOR:
That afternoon, under pressure, she joined me on the terrace. The sun was mild, and the children walked below us, the boy reading aloud, his arm around his sister.

NARRATOR:
Mrs. Grose watched them serenely, until, after a moment, she turned her attention to me—ready to hear more.

NARRATOR:
I recounted the events of the night. I told her of seeing Miles at the window and leading him silently through the house—through the very hallway where I had once trembled at the presence of Peter Quint—and up to his room.

NARRATOR:
Not a word had passed between us. I had wondered—desperately—what he would say. It was, after all, a sharp trap for the inscrutable. He could no longer pretend innocence. And yet—I felt almost more shaken by the risk of confronting *my own* fear than his.

NARRATOR:
In the moonlit room, where the bed was untouched and the window stood bare to the night, I sank onto the edge of the bed, gripped by the idea that he *knew* he “had” me. That I was the one on trial.

NARRATOR:
Still, I was kind. Never had I touched him more gently than when I placed my hands on his shoulders and quietly put it to him:

GOVERNESS:
You must tell me now—and all the truth. What did you go out for? What were you doing there?

NARRATOR:
He smiled—the whites of his eyes glinting in the dim light, his little teeth flashing.

MILES:
If I tell you why, will you understand?

NARRATOR:
My heart leapt. I could only nod, silently.

MILES:
Well... just exactly in order that *you* should do this.

GOVERNESS:
Do what?

MILES:
Think me—for a change—*bad*.

NARRATOR:
He said it with such sweetness and gaiety that I could scarcely breathe. He kissed me, and I returned it, folding him in my arms and stifling my tears.

NARRATOR:
He had given me the one answer that least permitted me to challenge him. I glanced about the room, grasping for certainty.

GOVERNESS:
Then... you didn’t undress at all?

MILES:
Not at all. I sat up and read.

GOVERNESS:
And when did you go down?

MILES:
At midnight. When I’m bad—I *am* bad!

GOVERNESS:
I see... it’s charming. But how did you know I’d find out?

MILES:
Oh, I arranged that with Flora. She was to get up and look out.

GOVERNESS:
Which is exactly what she did...

MILES:
So she disturbed you—and you saw.

GOVERNESS:
While *you*, I suppose, caught your death in the night air?

MILES:
(smiling)
How else should I have been bad enough?

NARRATOR:
He was radiant—full of triumph and mischief. After another embrace, the interview ended. And I was left with the dazzling charm of a boy who, for the sake of a “joke,” could summon such reserves of innocence—and darkness.

CHAPTER 12::

AT RISE: The terrace, late afternoon. Autumnal sunlight glows faintly on the lawn below, where MILES and FLORA stroll arm-in-arm, innocent in posture but unreadable in motive. On the terrace above, the GOVERNESS and MRS. GROSE sit, hushed, in quiet but urgent conversation. The GOVERNESS leans forward, voice low, eyes fixed not on the children, but on the space between them—the unseen. MRS. GROSE watches the children, yet her stillness betrays fear.


GOVERNESS:
(quietly, urgently)
It all lies in half a dozen words. He said: “Think, you know, what I might do.” And he said it to make me admire him. Because he knows—he knows exactly what he might do. That’s what he gave them a taste of at school.

MRS. GROSE:
(startled)
Lord, you do change!

GOVERNESS:
I don’t change. I make it out. The four of them—they meet. Constantly. And not a word, not a slip, not the ghost of a reference. Not to the dead. Not to the expelled. They sit there now, charming, laughing—reading aloud. But they’re not reading.
They’re summoning.
They’re speaking to the dead.

MRS. GROSE:
(visibly shaken, watching the children)
Of what other things have you got hold?

GOVERNESS:
Their beauty. Their goodness. It’s a game. A policy. A fraud. They haven’t been good—they’ve just been absent. Not mine. Not ours.
His. And hers.

MRS. GROSE:
Quint’s… and that woman’s?

GOVERNESS:
(firmly)
Yes. They want them back. They’re reaching for them.

MRS. GROSE:
But… for what?

GOVERNESS:
For the evil. To take it up again, as if it were a story paused. They’re trying to return to the lesson. And they will. If we don’t stop it.

MRS. GROSE:
(barely above a whisper)
But what… what can they do?

GOVERNESS:
(turning, sharply)
They can destroy them.

DIRECTION:
(MILES and FLORA pause in their walk, glance up toward the terrace. They wave sweetly. Innocently. They smile. Then resume their slow pace.)

GOVERNESS:
(quietly)
They will. Unless we intervene.

MRS. GROSE:
(standing now, voice trembling)
Then he must come. Their uncle. He must take them away.

GOVERNESS:
(incredulous)
And who will make him? You?

MRS. GROSE:
(looking directly at her)
You, miss.

GOVERNESS:
(standing now, her anger carefully restrained)
You want me to write him? To say: Your house is haunted, your niece and nephew possessed—and their governess? Possibly mad? Shall I send that?

MRS. GROSE:
(quiet, wary)
If it’s true…?

GOVERNESS:
(after a beat, softly, bitterly)
He hates trouble. That’s why he sent them here. That’s why they took him in.
And I’m not a fiend.
So I won’t.

DIRECTION:
(Pause. Mrs. Grose sits again and takes her arm.)

MRS. GROSE:
Make him come to you. He should be here.

GOVERNESS:
(suddenly rigid)
You see me—asking for him?

DIRECTION:
(Mrs. Grose falters. She sees the flash in the governess’s eyes—pride, shame, pain.)

GOVERNESS:
(warning)
If you so much as write to him for me… I will leave.
Both him—
And you.

DIRECTION:
(Blackout.)




CHAPTER 13::

NARRATOR:
It was all very well to join them, but speaking to them proved quite as much as ever an effort beyond my strength—offered, in close quarters, difficulties as insurmountable as before.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS sits quietly, observing the children at play. Despite their laughter, she cannot bring herself to speak.

NARRATOR:
This situation continued a month, and with new aggravations and particular notes, the note above all, sharper and sharper, of the small ironic consciousness on the part of my pupils.

DIRECTION:
MILES and FLORA occasionally exchange subtle glances—small smiles that seem loaded with unspoken understanding.

NARRATOR:
They were aware of my predicament and this strange relation made, in a manner, for a long time, the air in which we moved.

DIRECTION:
As the GOVERNESS speaks, MILES giggles softly and whispers in FLORA’s ear. She nods, eyes bright.

MILES:
(Sotto voce to Flora)
She thinks she’ll do it this time—but she won’t!

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS stiffens slightly as if she has overheard, but says nothing. She forces a smile.

NARRATOR:
All roads lead to Rome, and there were times when it might have struck us that almost every branch of study or subject of conversation skirted forbidden ground.

DIRECTION:
During a reading lesson, the GOVERNESS pauses over a passage that mentions death. The children quickly change the subject.

FLORA:
Miss, tell us again about Goody Gosling and the vicarage pony!

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS hesitates, then smiles weakly, shifting into the familiar tale.

GOVERNESS:
Ah yes... Goody Gosling said, "It takes a clever pony to pretend it’s stuck when it’s really resting."

DIRECTION:
The children laugh, but the sound is forced—too perfect.

NARRATOR:
There were many a corner round which I expected to come upon Quint, and many a situation that, in a merely sinister way, would have favored the appearance of Miss Jessel.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS walks alone along the hedgerow path. The trees rustle—she stops.

GOVERNESS:
(showing sudden alertness)
Is someone there?

DIRECTION:
No answer. But in the distance, a faint figure—a MAN with red hair and pale skin—appears.

PETER QUINT:
(Whispering on the wind)
He’s mine, still mine.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS whirls around, but he is gone.

NARRATOR:
The place, with its gray sky and withered garlands, its bared spaces and scattered dead leaves, was like a theater after the performance—all strewn with crumpled playbills.

DIRECTION:
Flashes of a summer long past haunt the GOVERNESS. The wind lifts the curtain—revealing nothing.

GOVERNESS:
(to herself)
Better to lose power than to lose sight.

DIRECTION:
Later that night, she walks the hallway. The air is still. Suddenly, a cold wind rushes past her.

MISS JESSEL:
(whispering)
She knows... she sees...

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS turns sharply—nothing there. She grips the stair rail.

GOVERNESS:
(to herself)
God help me... if they see more than I do.

NARRATOR:
There were times when I would have been ready to swear that, literally, in my presence, they had visitors who were known and were welcome.

DIRECTION:
Flora and Miles giggle in a corner of the schoolroom. Their eyes briefly glance to an empty chair.

GOVERNESS:
(blurting out)
They're here—you little wretches, you can't deny it now!

DIRECTION:
The children freeze—then smile.

MILES:
(cheerfully)
Miss, when do you think he will come?

FLORA:
Don’t you think we ought to write to Uncle?

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS is caught off guard by their sudden affection.

NARRATOR:
It was striking of the children to kiss me inveterately with a kind of wild irrelevance.

DIRECTION:
MILES kisses her cheek. FLORA hugs her waist. Their eyes remain cold.

GOVERNESS:
(quietly, trying to smile)
He never answers, you know. But I keep your letters. They are too beautiful to send.

DIRECTION:
She opens a drawer and gazes at the stack of unsent letters.

NARRATOR:
They were too beautiful to be posted; I kept them myself; I have them all to this hour.

DIRECTION:
Later, the GOVERNESS lies awake, whispering names.

GOVERNESS:
(whispers)
Peter Quint... Miss Jessel...

DIRECTION:
She covers her face, ashamed.

NARRATOR:
“They have the manners to be silent, and you, trusted as you are, the baseness to speak!”

DIRECTION:
Suddenly, the room plunges into a strange stillness.

NARRATOR:
Then it was that the others, the outsiders, were there.

PETER QUINT:
(softly)
Let us have him.

MISS JESSEL:
(softly)
She can't protect them.

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS trembles but doesn’t move. The whispers fade.

NARRATOR:
The cruel idea that, whatever I had seen, Miles and Flora saw more...

DIRECTION:
The next day, the children resume their games.

MILES:
(playfully)
Shall we write to Uncle again?

FLORA:
He may come tomorrow!

DIRECTION:
The GOVERNESS nods with a hollow smile.

NARRATOR:
It was the relief of a snap to a strain. It came with a rush.

DIRECTION:
Thunder cracks. A storm rolls in.

GOVERNESS:
(to herself)
Change. At last.

END OF CHAPTER 13






CHAPTER 14::

DIRECTION:
A crisp, clear Sunday morning. The Governess walks with Miles at her side; Flora walks ahead with Mrs. Grose, well in sight. The church bells ring in the sharp autumn air.

MILES:
(cheerfully)
Look here, my dear, you know—when in the world, please, am I going back to school?

DIRECTION:
The Governess stops short, stunned by the question. A new tension opens between them.

GOVERNESS:
(trying to maintain composure)
And always with the same lady?

MILES:
Ah, of course, she's a jolly, 'perfect' lady; but, after all, I'm a fellow, don't you see? That's—well, getting on.

GOVERNESS:
(gently)
Yes, you're getting on.

MILES:
And you can't say I've not been awfully good, can you?

GOVERNESS:
No, I can't say that, Miles.

MILES:
Except just that one night, you know—!

GOVERNESS:
That one night?

MILES:
Why, when I went down—went out of the house.

GOVERNESS:
Oh, yes. But I forget what you did it for.

MILES:
(pretending hurt)
You forget? Why, it was to show you I could!

GOVERNESS:
Oh, yes, you could.

MILES:
And I can again.

GOVERNESS:
Certainly. But you won't.

MILES:
No, not THAT again. It was nothing.

GOVERNESS:
It was nothing. But we must go on.

DIRECTION:
They continue walking, Miles takes the Governess’s arm.

MILES:
Then when AM I going back?

GOVERNESS:
Were you very happy at school?

MILES:
Oh, I'm happy enough anywhere!

GOVERNESS:
Well, then, if you're just as happy here—

MILES:
Ah, but that isn't everything! Of course YOU know a lot—

GOVERNESS:
But you hint that you know almost as much?

MILES:
Not half I want to! But it isn't so much that.

GOVERNESS:
What is it, then?

MILES:
Well—I want to see more life.

DIRECTION:
They arrive near the church. Villagers and the household are gathered outside.

GOVERNESS:
(quickening pace)
There are not many of your own sort, Miles! Unless perhaps dear little Flora!

MILES:
(disbelieving)
You really compare me to a baby girl?

GOVERNESS:
Don't you, then, LOVE our sweet Flora?

MILES:
(deflecting)
If I didn't—and you, too; if I didn't—!

DIRECTION:
They stop again, alone among the graves. They stand near a low, tablelike tomb.

GOVERNESS:
Yes, if you didn't—?

MILES:
Well, you know what!

GOVERNESS:
(sitting on the stone, softly)
Does my uncle think what YOU think?

MILES:
How do you know what I think?

GOVERNESS:
I don't; for it strikes me you never tell me. But I mean—does HE know?

MILES:
Know what?

GOVERNESS:
Why, the way I'm going on.

GOVERNESS:
I don't think your uncle much cares.

MILES:
(looking directly at her)
Then don't you think he can be made to?

GOVERNESS:
In what way?

MILES:
Why, by his coming down.

GOVERNESS:
But who'll get him to come down?

MILES:
(grinning)
I will!

DIRECTION:
Miles gives a charged look, then marches off alone into the church. The Governess remains seated on the tomb, stunned.

* This scene underscores the shift in Miles, who grows increasingly bold and enigmatic. His veiled defiance and the Governess's internal struggle build mounting tension.
* The dialogue format brings the moment to life, heightening the ambiguity of Miles's motives and the pressure on the Governess to maintain control.

















CHAPTER 15::

AT RISE:
A cool autumn morning. The church bells ring cheerfully in the distance. The sun casts a soft glow across the churchyard and surrounding grounds. The park is quiet, golden with leaves. The Governess stands beside a stone tomb, alone.

DIRECTION:
The Governess stands motionless, staring ahead, overwhelmed by the weight of her conversation with Miles.

NARRATOR:
The business was practically settled from the moment I never followed him. It was a pitiful surrender to agitation, but my being aware of this had somehow no power to restore me. I only sat there on my tomb and read into what my little friend had said to me the fullness of its meaning.

DIRECTION:
She lowers herself to the stone slab, quietly stunned.

NARRATOR:
By the time I had grasped the whole of it, I had also embraced, for absence, the pretext that I was ashamed to offer my pupils and the rest of the congregation such an example of delay. What I said to myself above all was that Miles had got something out of me.

DIRECTION:
She reflects, torn between guilt and anger.

NARRATOR:
He had got out of me that there was something I was much afraid of, and that he should probably be able to make use of my fear to gain, for his own purpose, more freedom.

DIRECTION:
The Governess rises, begins pacing along the church wall, struggling to calm herself.

NARRATOR:
What was so unnatural for the particular boy I was concerned with was this sudden revelation of a consciousness and a plan.

DIRECTION:
She halts beneath the high east window, listening to the sounds of worship.

NARRATOR:
I might easily put an end to my predicament by getting away altogether. Here was my chance; there was no one to stop me.

DIRECTION:
A wave of fear and desperation overtakes her. She turns back through the park toward the house, hurriedly.

NARRATOR:
I came straight out of the churchyard and, thinking hard, retraced my steps through the park. It seemed to me that by the time I reached the house I had made up my mind I would fly.

DIRECTION:
She arrives at the house breathless. The interior is still and quiet. She pauses in the hall, overtaken by dread.

NARRATOR:
Tormented, in the hall, with difficulties and obstacles, I remember sinking down at the foot of the staircase—suddenly collapsing there on the lowest step.

DIRECTION:
She suddenly recoils, remembering a past vision of terror on that very spot.

NARRATOR:
I recalled that it was exactly where, more than a month before, in the darkness of night, I had seen the specter of the most horrible of women.

DIRECTION:
She straightens with resolve and climbs the stairs toward the schoolroom.

NARRATOR:
I made, in my bewilderment, for the schoolroom, where there were objects belonging to me that I should have to take. But I opened the door to find again, in a flash, my eyes unsealed.

DIRECTION:
The schoolroom door opens. The Governess freezes in the doorway.

DIRECTION:
At the table, seated in the light of day, is a figure with her head resting in her hands.

GOVERNESS:
*(Whispers, horrified)*
No...

DIRECTION:
The figure remains unmoved. The air is thick with dread. The Governess steps into the room.

NARRATOR:
Seated at my own table in clear noonday light I saw a person whom, without my previous experience, I should have taken for some housemaid who might have stayed at home.

DIRECTION:
The figure slowly begins to stir.

NARRATOR:
Then it was—with the very act of its announcing itself—that her identity flared up in a change of posture.

DIRECTION:
The woman rises. She is dark, haggard, haunting. Miss Jessel.

GOVERNESS:
*(Startled, involuntarily)*
You terrible, miserable woman!

DIRECTION:
Miss Jessel stands, unmoving, staring with deep sorrow and disdain. She is a vision of despair.

NARRATOR:
Dishonored and tragic, she was all before me; but even as I fixed and, for memory, secured it, the awful image passed away.

DIRECTION:
In an instant, she vanishes. The schoolroom is silent again.

NARRATOR:
Dark as midnight in her black dress, her haggard beauty and her unutterable woe, she had looked at me long enough to appear to say that her right to sit at my table was as good as mine to sit at hers.

DIRECTION:
The Governess gasps, steadies herself.

NARRATOR:
While these instants lasted, indeed, I had the extraordinary chill of feeling that it was I who was the intruder.

DIRECTION:
She steps back to the doorway.

GOVERNESS:
*(Barely above a whisper)*
I must stay.

DIRECTION:
The sun pours into the now-empty room. She remains standing, resolute, shaken, but grounded.

NARRATOR:
There was nothing in the room the next minute but the sunshine and a sense that I must stay.




























CHAPTER 16::

DIRECTION:
The Governess waits for a reaction from the children about her absence, but none comes. She studies Mrs. Grose, suspicious of an unspoken arrangement.

MRS. GROSE:
Oh, yes, they asked me to say nothing; and to please them—so long as they were there—of course I promised. But what had happened to you?

GOVERNESS:
I only went with you for the walk. I had then to come back to meet a friend.

MRS. GROSE:
A friend—YOU?

GOVERNESS:
Oh, yes, I have a couple! (laughs) But did the children give you a reason?

MRS. GROSE:
For not alluding to your leaving us? Yes; they said you would like it better. Do you like it better?

GOVERNESS:
No, I like it worse! (pauses) Did they say why I should like it better?

MRS. GROSE:
No; Master Miles only said, "We must do nothing but what she likes!"

GOVERNESS:
I wish indeed he would. And what did Flora say?

MRS. GROSE:
Miss Flora was too sweet. She said, "Oh, of course, of course!"—and I said the same.

GOVERNESS:
You were too sweet, too—I can hear you all. But nonetheless, between Miles and me, it's now all out.

MRS. GROSE:
All out? But what, miss?

GOVERNESS:
Everything. It doesn't matter. I've made up my mind. I came home, my dear, for a talk with Miss Jessel.

MRS. GROSE:
A talk! Do you mean she spoke?

GOVERNESS:
It came to that. I found her, on my return, in the schoolroom.

MRS. GROSE:
And what did she say?

GOVERNESS:
That she suffers the torments—

MRS. GROSE:
Do you mean—the torments of the lost?

GOVERNESS:
Of the lost. Of the damned. And that's why, to share them—

MRS. GROSE:
To share them—?

GOVERNESS:
She wants Flora.

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose nearly falls away from the Governess, but she holds her firm.

MRS. GROSE:
Because you've made up your mind? But to what?

GOVERNESS:
To everything.

MRS. GROSE:
And what do you call "everything"?

GOVERNESS:
Why, sending for their uncle.

MRS. GROSE:
Oh, miss, in pity do!

GOVERNESS:
Ah, but I will, I WILL! I see it's the only way. What's 'out,' as I told you, with Miles is that if he thinks I'm afraid to—and has ideas of what he gains by that—he shall see he's mistaken. Yes, yes; his uncle shall have it here from me on the spot (and before the boy himself, if necessary) that if I'm to be reproached with having done nothing again about more school—

MRS. GROSE:
Yes, miss—

GOVERNESS:
Well, there's that awful reason.

MRS. GROSE:
But—a—which?

GOVERNESS:
Why, the letter from his old place.

MRS. GROSE:
You'll show it to the master?

GOVERNESS:
I ought to have done so on the instant.

MRS. GROSE:
Oh, no!

GOVERNESS:
I'll put it before him that I can't undertake to work the question on behalf of a child who has been expelled—

MRS. GROSE:
For we've never in the least known what!

GOVERNESS:
For wickedness. For what else—when he's so clever and beautiful and perfect? Is he stupid? Is he untidy? Is he infirm? Is he ill-natured? He's exquisite—so it can be only THAT; and that would open up the whole thing. After all, it's their uncle's fault. If he left here such people—!

MRS. GROSE:
He didn't really in the least know them. The fault's mine.

GOVERNESS:
Well, you shan't suffer.

MRS. GROSE:
The children shan't!

GOVERNESS:
Then what am I to tell him?

MRS. GROSE:
You needn't tell him anything. I'll tell him.

GOVERNESS:
Do you mean you'll write—? (remembers) How do you communicate?

MRS. GROSE:
I tell the bailiff. HE writes.

GOVERNESS:
And should you like him to write our story?

DIRECTION:
Mrs. Grose breaks down, tears returning to her eyes.

MRS. GROSE:
Ah, miss, YOU write!

GOVERNESS:
Well—tonight.

DIRECTION:
They separate.






























CHAPTER 17: FORMATTED SCRIPT FOR THEATERIZER

DIRECTION:
*Evening. Wind and rain batter the windows. In the Governess's room, she sits beside a sleeping Flora with a blank letter in front of her. She rises, candle in hand, and crosses the hall.*

MILES:
*(From inside his room, cheerfully)*
I say, you there—come in.

DIRECTION:
*She enters to find Miles in bed, awake and smiling.*

GOVERNESS:
How did you know I was there?

MILES:
Why, of course I heard you. Did you fancy you made no noise? You're like a troop of cavalry!

GOVERNESS:
Then you weren't asleep?

MILES:
Not much! I lie awake and think.

GOVERNESS:
What is it that you think of?

MILES:
What in the world, my dear, but YOU?

GOVERNESS:
Ah, the pride I take in your appreciation doesn't insist on that! I had so far rather you slept.

MILES:
Well, I think also, you know, of this queer business of ours.

GOVERNESS:
Of what queer business, Miles?

MILES:
Why, the way you bring me up. And all the rest!

GOVERNESS:
What do you mean by all the rest?

MILES:
Oh, you know, you know!

GOVERNESS:
Certainly you shall go back to school—if it be that that troubles you. But not to the old place—we must find another, a better. How could I know it did trouble you, when you never told me?

MILES:
Haven't I?

GOVERNESS:
No, never. You've never said a word to me about your school. Never, little Miles—no, never.

MILES:
I don't—I don't. I want to get away.

GOVERNESS:
You're tired of Bly?

MILES:
Oh, no, I like Bly.

GOVERNESS:
Well, then—?

MILES:
Oh, YOU know what a boy wants!

GOVERNESS:
You want to go to your uncle?

MILES:
Ah, you can't get off with that!

GOVERNESS:
My dear, I don't want to get off!

MILES:
You can't, even if you do. You can't, you can't! My uncle must come down, and you must completely settle things.

GOVERNESS:
If we do, you may be sure it will be to take you quite away.

MILES:
Well, don't you understand that's exactly what I'm working for? You'll have to tell him—about the way you've let it all drop: you'll have to tell him a tremendous lot!

GOVERNESS:
And how much will YOU, Miles, have to tell him? There are things he'll ask you!

MILES:
Very likely. But what things?

GOVERNESS:
The things you've never told me. He can't send you back—

MILES:
Oh, I don't want to go back! I want a new field.

DIRECTION:
*The Governess is overwhelmed by the strange maturity and defiance in Miles.*

GOVERNESS:
Dear little Miles, dear little Miles—!

MILES:
Well, old lady?

GOVERNESS:
Is there nothing—nothing at all that you want to tell me?

MILES:
I've told you—I told you this morning.

GOVERNESS:
That you just want me not to worry you?

MILES:
To let me alone.

DIRECTION:
*The Governess rises slowly but lingers.*

GOVERNESS:
I've just begun a letter to your uncle.

MILES:
Well, then, finish it!

GOVERNESS:
What happened before?

MILES:
Before what?

GOVERNESS:
Before you came back. And before you went away.

MILES:
What happened?

GOVERNESS:
Dear little Miles, if you KNEW how I want to help you! I'd rather die than hurt a hair of you. I just want you to help me to save you!

DIRECTION:
*Suddenly a freezing wind blasts through the room. The candle is snuffed. Miles shrieks.*

GOVERNESS:
Why, the candle's out!

MILES:
It was I who blew it, dear!

DIRECTION:
*Darkness. Silence.*



























CHAPTER 18

MRS. GROSE:
Have you written, miss?

GOVERNESS:
Yes—I've written.

NARRATOR:
But I didn’t add—for the hour—that my letter, sealed and directed, was still in my pocket. There would be time enough to send it before the messenger should go to the village.

NARRATOR:
Meanwhile there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more brilliant, more exemplary morning. They performed dizzy feats of arithmetic, soared beyond my range, and delivered jokes with high spirits. Miles especially acted as if to show how easily he could disarm me.

NARRATOR:
After our early dinner, Miles approached me with a gentle tact.

MILES:
Shouldn’t you like me, for half an hour, to play to you?

NARRATOR:
I could hardly resist. He played as never before. I listened, mesmerized—until I startled up. I had forgotten Flora.

GOVERNESS:
Where, all this time, is Flora?

MILES:
Why, my dear, how do I know?

NARRATOR:
He laughed and broke into extravagant song.

NARRATOR:
I searched my room, others in the house—nothing. Assuming she might be with Mrs. Grose, I went to her.

GOVERNESS:
Is Flora with you?

MRS. GROSE:
I thought you had taken both the children. Isn’t she upstairs?

GOVERNESS:
No; she’s at a distance.

MRS. GROSE:
Without a hat?

GOVERNESS:
Isn’t that woman always without one? She’s with HER!

MRS. GROSE:
And Master Miles?

GOVERNESS:
He’s with Quint. They’re in the schoolroom. The trick’s played. He found a divine little way to distract me while she slipped off.

MRS. GROSE:
'Divine'?

GOVERNESS:
Infernal, then!

MRS. GROSE:
You leave him—so long with Quint?

GOVERNESS:
Yes—I don’t mind that now.

MRS. GROSE:
Because of your letter?

NARRATOR:
I pulled the letter from my pocket and placed it on the hall table.

GOVERNESS:
Luke will take it.

NARRATOR:
I flung open the house door and descended the steps.

MRS. GROSE:
You go with nothing on?

GOVERNESS:
What do I care when the child has nothing? I can’t wait to dress.

NARRATOR:
I stepped into the gray afternoon. Mrs. Grose hesitated only a moment longer—then followed me.

CHAPTER 19

NARRATOR:
We went straight to the lake, as it was called at Bly. I had an intimate conviction that Flora was not near home. Since our previous adventure at the pond, I'd sensed her pull to return alone. I led Mrs. Grose in that direction.

MRS. GROSE:
You're going to the water, Miss?—you think she's IN—?

GOVERNESS:
She may be. But what I judge most likely is that she's on the spot from which, the other day, we saw what I told you.

MRS. GROSE:
When she pretended not to see—?

GOVERNESS:
With that astounding self-possession? I've always been sure she wanted to go back alone. And now her brother has managed it for her.

MRS. GROSE:
You suppose they really TALK of them?

GOVERNESS:
They say things that, if we heard them, would simply appall us.

MRS. GROSE:
And if she IS there—

GOVERNESS:
Then Miss Jessel is. You shall see.

NARRATOR:
I went straight on. Mrs. Grose, reluctant, followed. We reached the water—no sign of Flora. I pointed to the empty mooring.

GOVERNESS:
She has taken the boat.

MRS. GROSE:
Then where is it?

GOVERNESS:
She has used it to go over—and hidden it.

MRS. GROSE:
All alone—that child?

GOVERNESS:
She's not alone. And at such times she's not a child—she's an old, old woman.

MRS. GROSE:
But if the boat’s there, where on earth’s SHE?

GOVERNESS:
That’s exactly what we must learn.

MRS. GROSE:
By going all the way round?

GOVERNESS:
Certainly. It will take but ten minutes.

NARRATOR:
We trudged around the pond. Eventually, we reached a point where I saw the boat—hidden but unmistakably there.

MRS. GROSE:
Laws!

NARRATOR:
We passed through a fence gate and emerged into the open.

BOTH:
There she is!

NARRATOR:
Flora stood on the grass, smiling, then stooped to pluck a withered fern. She waited silently. Mrs. Grose ran forward, dropped to her knees, and embraced the girl. Flora looked at me solemnly. When Mrs. Grose rose, still holding her hand, Flora gazed at us.

FLORA:
Why, where are your things?

GOVERNESS:
Where yours are, my dear!

FLORA:
And where's Miles?

GOVERNESS:
I'll tell you if you'll tell me—

FLORA:
Well, what?

GOVERNESS:
Where, my pet, is Miss Jessel?

































CHAPTER 20::

NARRATOR:
Just as in the churchyard with Miles, the whole thing was upon us. The child's face, struck by the name I had dared to speak, froze like glass shattered by a stone.

MRS. GROSE:
(shrieks)
Oh—!

NARRATOR:
Her cry rose with mine.

GOVERNESS:
(grasping Mrs. Grose's arm)
She's there, she's there!

NARRATOR:
Miss Jessel stood before us on the opposite bank—exactly as she had before. My first thrill was joy. She was there, and I was justified.

NARRATOR:
I threw out to her, that ravenous demon, a wild, silent message of gratitude. She rose upright on the very spot Mrs. Grose and I had lately stood. And every inch of her evil seemed to radiate across the water.

NARRATOR:
Mrs. Grose blinked toward where I pointed. But even before her gaze landed, my eyes shot to the child.

NARRATOR:
What I saw startled me more than the ghost. Flora showed no fear. She didn’t even glance toward the apparition. She stared at me with a hard, silent gravity—unmoving, unreadable, and absolutely new.

GOVERNESS:
(passionately)
She’s there, you little unhappy thing—there, there, THERE, and you see her as well as you see me!

NARRATOR:
But Flora didn’t flinch. Her eyes held mine with fixed reprobation. She was no longer a child—she was the presence that made me quail.

MRS. GROSE:
(shocked)
What a dreadful turn, to be sure, miss! Where on earth do you see anything?

GOVERNESS:
(seizing her, pointing)
You don’t see her as WE do? She’s as big as a blazing fire! Look, dearest woman—LOOK!

NARRATOR:
Mrs. Grose looked, but only returned a groan—denial, pity, revulsion. Her pity touched me, her blindness crushed me.

NARRATOR:
My own sight was undimmed, and there stood Miss Jessel—still, vivid, triumphant. And yet, most dreadful now, was Flora’s cold defiance.

MRS. GROSE:
(breathlessly reassuring Flora)
She isn’t there, little lady, and nobody’s there. You never see nothing, my sweet! Poor Miss Jessel’s dead and buried—we know that, don’t we, love?

NARRATOR:
Flora stood firm, clinging to Mrs. Grose, her face unreadable—except in its rejection of me.

FLORA:
(quietly, with venom)
I don’t know what you mean. I see nobody. I see nothing. I never HAVE. I think you’re cruel. I don’t like you!

NARRATOR:
She hugged Mrs. Grose more tightly and pressed her dreadful little face into her skirts.

FLORA:
(sobbing)
Take me away, take me away—oh, take me away from HER!

GOVERNESS:
(breathless)
From ME?

FLORA:
(crying out)
From you—from you!

NARRATOR:
Even Mrs. Grose looked at me in dismay. I turned once more toward the still figure across the lake. Rigid, unmoving, it loomed—present for me, absent for them.

GOVERNESS:
(to Flora, solemnly)
If I had ever doubted, I doubt no longer. Of course I’ve lost you. I interfered—and you’ve seen, under HER dictation, the easy, perfect way to meet it.

(turns toward the ghost)
I’ve done my best, but I’ve lost you. Goodbye.

(to Mrs. Grose, urgent)
Go, go!

NARRATOR:
In infinite distress, but holding the girl, Mrs. Grose fled with her down the path. I was left alone.

NARRATOR:
Of what happened at first, I remember nothing. But after perhaps a quarter of an hour, cold and damp soaking me, I knew I had thrown myself on the ground and sobbed.

NARRATOR:
When I raised my head, the day was nearly done. I looked again at the gray pool and the haunted bank. Then I walked the long way back to the house.

NARRATOR:
To my surprise, the boat was gone. Flora, I thought, had made sure of her escape.

NARRATOR:
That night, she stayed with Mrs. Grose—by silent, mutual agreement. I didn’t see them again that day. But I saw Miles. Oh, how I saw him. As if it were more than ever before.

NARRATOR:
I made no effort to inquire after him. He had his freedom now—and he used it. But at eight o’clock, he entered the schoolroom quietly and sat beside me by the fire.

NARRATOR:
We said nothing. But he sat there, in the flicker of the firelight. Still. Present. As if, despite everything, he wanted to be with me.






































CHAPTER 21::

NARRATOR:
Before dawn fully broke, I woke to find Mrs. Grose at my bedside with worse news.

MRS. GROSE:
Flora’s feverish, miss—markedly. She passed a night of extreme unrest. But it wasn’t Miss Jessel she feared... it was *you*.

NARRATOR:
I leapt from the bed, flooded with questions. Yet I saw she had already braced herself.

GOVERNESS:
She *still* denies having seen anything?

MRS. GROSE:
Ah, miss... it's not something I can push her on. But I don’t think I need to. Every inch of her now feels... quite old.

GOVERNESS:
She resents the implication—as if I’ve doubted her “respectability.” *Respectable*, the chit! Yesterday she was more a stranger to me than ever before. I put my foot in it. She’ll never speak to me again.

NARRATOR:
Mrs. Grose nodded, with troubled honesty.

MRS. GROSE:
She never will. She does have a *grand* manner about it.

GOVERNESS:
And *that* manner is what’s the matter with her now.

MRS. GROSE:
She keeps asking if I think you’re coming in.

GOVERNESS:
I see. And has she said a *word* since yesterday about Miss Jessel?

MRS. GROSE:
Not one. And... you know, miss, I *did* take it from her by the lake that there was nobody.

GOVERNESS:
Of course. And you still take it from her.

MRS. GROSE:
I don’t contradict her. What *can* I do?

GOVERNESS:
Nothing. She has her grievance now—and she’ll ride it to the end.

MRS. GROSE:
But to *what* end?

GOVERNESS:
To turn her uncle against me. She’ll make me out a monster.

NARRATOR:
Mrs. Grose paled, imagining it.

MRS. GROSE:
And him who thinks so well of you...

GOVERNESS:
He has a *strange* way of showing it! But no matter. Flora wants rid of me.

MRS. GROSE:
Never to so much as look at you again.

GOVERNESS:
Then you’ve come to speed me away?

NARRATOR:
She hesitated, but I cut her off.

GOVERNESS:
No—*you* must go. Take Flora.

MRS. GROSE:
But where?

GOVERNESS:
Away. From here. From *them*. Even—now—from me. Straight to her uncle.

MRS. GROSE:
Only to tell on you?

GOVERNESS:
Not *only*. To leave me with my remedy.

MRS. GROSE:
And what is that?

GOVERNESS:
Your loyalty. And Miles’s.

MRS. GROSE:
You think he won’t turn on you?

GOVERNESS:
Yes—I believe he wants to *speak*. Last night, by the firelight—two hours of silence—it was almost coming.

MRS. GROSE:
And did it?

GOVERNESS:
No. Not a word. Not even about Flora. But I must try. He needs a little more time.

MRS. GROSE:
More time?

GOVERNESS:
A day or two. If nothing comes, I’ll fail—but at least you’ll have done what you can in town. Unless...

NARRATOR:
I searched her face.

GOVERNESS:
Unless you *don’t* want to go?

MRS. GROSE:
I’ll go. I’ll go *this* morning.

GOVERNESS:
If you wish to wait, I promise Flora won’t see me.

MRS. GROSE:
No—it’s the *place*. She must leave it.

GOVERNESS:
She may recover? Be free?

MRS. GROSE:
Yes. She must be far from this... from *them*.

GOVERNESS:
Then in spite of yesterday—you believe?

MRS. GROSE:
In *such doings*? I believe.

NARRATOR:
I nearly wept. We were still united. If she would answer for my honesty, I could answer for the rest.

GOVERNESS:
But—my letter. It’ll reach town before you.

MRS. GROSE:
Your letter... won’t have got there.

GOVERNESS:
What?

MRS. GROSE:
Your letter never went.

GOVERNESS:
What became of it?

MRS. GROSE:
Luke says he never touched it. But when I came back with Flora, it wasn’t where you left it.

GOVERNESS:
Miles... took it?

MRS. GROSE:
He must have.

GOVERNESS:
Then he read it. And destroyed it.

MRS. GROSE:
And don’t you see anything else?

GOVERNESS:
I see your eyes are open wider than mine now.

MRS. GROSE:
I make out what he did at school.

GOVERNESS:
You mean—?

MRS. GROSE:
(sternly)
He stole.

GOVERNESS:
(still composed)
Perhaps.

MRS. GROSE:
He stole *letters*! It's clear now.

GOVERNESS:
I hope it served him better than this. But the note I left yesterday only asked for an interview. He gained nothing. That’s why he wants to confess. Leave us—I’ll get it out of him.

MRS. GROSE:
And if he confesses?

GOVERNESS:
Then he’s saved. And if he’s saved—

MRS. GROSE:
Then *you* are?

NARRATOR:
She kissed me, tears bright in her eyes.

MRS. GROSE:
I’ll save you without him!

NARRATOR:
And with that, she was gone.

CHAPTER 22

NARRATOR:
Yet it was when she had got off—and I missed her on the spot—that the great pinch really came. If I had counted on the comfort of being alone with Miles, I soon realized that what it gave me instead was a measure of dread.

No hour of my stay was so full of apprehension as the one in which I learned the carriage containing Mrs. Grose and Flora had already rolled out of the gates. Now I was alone—with the elements.

NARRATOR:
All through that morning, I paraded the house with false firmness, trying to mask my fear with the appearance of readiness. I saw how blankly the staff looked on, confused by Mrs. Grose’s sudden departure, and my strange insistence on maintaining calm.

NARRATOR:
But the person least disturbed appeared to be Miles. He had vanished before I came down, and I was told he had gone for a walk after breakfasting with his sister and Mrs. Grose. He had made it clear: he had no more use for the fiction that I was his teacher.

NARRATOR:
It was strange, the sense of relief in that. It was done—we no longer pretended. He had his freedom now, and I would not touch it again.

NARRATOR:
When at last he returned, it was as though nothing that had happened had left a mark upon his small, perfect form. He seemed luminous, untouched.

NARRATOR:
To make clear the new formality between us, I decreed our meals should be taken downstairs, in the formal dining room. There, where once I had seen a ghost from the window, I waited for Miles.

NARRATOR:
To sit with him now was to face not a child, but something more subtle. I had decided: if I could not confront the evil behind him directly, I would try at least to reach his intelligence—to speak, somehow, through his brightness.

NARRATOR:
He entered quietly, hands in pockets, and looked at the roast mutton on the table.

MILES:
I say, my dear, is she really very awfully ill?

GOVERNESS:
Little Flora? Not so bad. London will set her up. Bly had ceased to agree with her. Come here and take your mutton.

NARRATOR:
He obeyed gracefully, taking his seat with all his usual charm.

MILES:
Did Bly disagree with her so terribly suddenly?

GOVERNESS:
Not so suddenly as you might think. One had seen it coming on.

MILES:
Then why didn’t you get her off before?

GOVERNESS:
Before what?

MILES:
Before she became too ill to travel.

GOVERNESS:
She’s *not* too ill. She might have become so if she’d stayed. This was just the moment to seize. The journey will dissipate the influence—and carry it off.

NARRATOR:
Miles accepted this grand explanation with equal grandeur, eating with that elegant grace that never needed correction. But he was more conscious than ever, trying harder to take things for granted.

NARRATOR:
The meal was short—mine a mere pretense—and I had the table cleared quickly. While the maid worked, Miles stood with his back to me, staring out the window\... the very same from which I had once seen a figure in the dusk.

NARRATOR:
Neither of us spoke in the maid’s presence. We were like a newly married couple, too shy to speak in front of the waiter. When the room was finally ours, he turned to me.

MILES:
Well—so we’re alone!








































Here is CHAPTER 23 adapted into your dramatic script format, following the rhythm and structure of the previous chapters:

---

CHAPTER 23

MILES:
Oh, more or less.

NARRATOR:
I fancy my smile was pale.

GOVERNESS:
Not absolutely. We shouldn't like that!

MILES:
No—I suppose we shouldn't. Of course we have the others.

GOVERNESS:
We have the others—we have indeed the others.

MILES:
Yet even though we have them... they don’t much count, do they?

GOVERNESS:
It depends on what you call "much."

MILES:
Yes—everything depends.

NARRATOR:
He turned to the window and drifted toward it, resting his forehead against the pane. I moved to the sofa, watching his slender back. For once, I felt I was not the one barred out—he was. Shut in or shut out, I couldn’t tell, but it was *he* who searched in vain through the pane. I saw in him the first crack of doubt. He was admirable—but not comfortable.

MILES:
Well, I think I’m glad Bly agrees with *me*!

GOVERNESS:
You would certainly seem to have seen, these twenty-four hours, a good deal more of it than for some time before. I hope you’ve been enjoying yourself.

MILES:
Oh yes, I’ve been ever so far—all round about. Miles and miles away. I’ve never been so free.

GOVERNESS:
Well, do you like it?

MILES:
Do *you*?

NARRATOR:
Before I could answer, he softened his tone.

MILES:
Nothing could be more charming than the way you take it—for of course if we’re alone together now, it’s *you* that are alone most. But I hope you don’t particularly mind?

GOVERNESS:
Having to do with you? My dear child, how can I help minding? Though I’ve renounced all claim to your company—you’re so beyond me—I at least greatly enjoy it. What else should I stay on for?

MILES:
You stay on just for *that*?

GOVERNESS:
Certainly. I stay on as your friend and from the tremendous interest I take in you—till something can be done for you that may be more worth your while.

NARRATOR:
My voice trembled. I recalled that night of the storm.

GOVERNESS:
Don’t you remember how I told you, when I came and sat on your bed, that there was nothing in the world I wouldn’t do for you?

MILES:
Yes, yes!
(Laughing nervously)
Only that, I think, was to get me to do something for *you*!

GOVERNESS:
It was partly to get you to do something. But you didn’t do it.

MILES:
Oh yes—you wanted me to tell you something.

GOVERNESS:
That’s it. Out, straight out. What you have on your mind.

MILES:
Ah, then—is *that* what you’ve stayed over for?

GOVERNESS:
Well, yes—I may as well make a clean breast of it. It was precisely for that.

MILES:
Do you mean now—here?

GOVERNESS:
There couldn’t be a better place or time.

NARRATOR:
He looked around, uneasy, almost afraid. I softened.

GOVERNESS:
You want so to go out again?

MILES:
Awfully!

NARRATOR:
He smiled heroically, flushing with pain. He picked up his hat and twirled it in his hands. Even then I was seized by a perverse horror of what I was doing—wasn’t this, to him, a crude violation of our delicate connection?

MILES:
I’ll tell you everything—I mean I’ll tell you anything you like. You’ll stay on with me, and we shall both be all right, and I *will* tell you—I *will*. But not now.

GOVERNESS:
Why not now?

NARRATOR:
He returned to the window in silence. Then—

MILES:
I have to see Luke.

NARRATOR:
His lie was crude—but proof. Still knitting, I responded coolly.

GOVERNESS:
Well then, go to Luke, and I’ll wait for what you promise.
But in return, satisfy one much smaller request.

MILES:
Very much smaller?

GOVERNESS:
Yes, a mere fraction of the whole.
Tell me—if yesterday afternoon, from the table in the hall—you took... you know\... my letter.










































CHAPTER 24::

NARRATOR:
My sense of how he received this suffered for a minute from something that I can describe only as a fierce split of my attention—a stroke that at first, as I sprang straight up, reduced me to the mere blind movement of getting hold of him, drawing him close, and, while I just fell for support against the nearest piece of furniture, instinctively keeping him with his back to the window.

The appearance was full upon us that I had already had to deal with here: Peter Quint had come into view like a sentinel before a prison. The next thing I saw was that, from outside, he had reached the window, and then I knew that, close to the glass and glaring in through it, he offered once more to the room his white face of damnation.

It represents but grossly what took place within me at the sight to say that on the second my decision was made; yet I believe that no woman so overwhelmed ever in so short a time recovered her grasp of the ACT.

MILES:
Yes—I took it.

NARRATOR:
At this, with a moan of joy, I enfolded, I drew him close...

GOVERNESS:
What did you take it for?

MILES:
To see what you said about me.

GOVERNESS:
You opened the letter?

MILES:
I opened it.

NARRATOR:
My eyes were now, as I held him off a little again, on Miles's own face...

GOVERNESS:
And you found nothing!

MILES:
Nothing.

GOVERNESS:
Nothing, nothing!

MILES:
Nothing, nothing.

GOVERNESS:
So what have you done with it?

MILES:
I've burned it.

GOVERNESS:
Burned it? Is that what you did at school?

MILES:
At school?

GOVERNESS:
Did you take letters?—or other things?

MILES:
Other things?... Did I STEAL?

GOVERNESS:
Was it for that you mightn't go back?

MILES:
Did you know I mightn't go back?

GOVERNESS:
I know everything.

MILES:
Everything?

GOVERNESS:
Everything. Therefore DID you—?

MILES:
No. I didn't steal.

GOVERNESS:
What then did you do?

MILES:
Well—I said things.

GOVERNESS:
Only that?

MILES:
They thought it was enough!

GOVERNESS:
To turn you out for?

MILES:
Well, I suppose I oughtn't.

GOVERNESS:
But to whom did you say them?

MILES:
I don't know!

GOVERNESS:
Was it to everyone?

MILES:
No—only to… I don't remember their names.

GOVERNESS:
Were they then so many?

MILES:
No—only a few. Those I liked.

NARRATOR:
I seemed to float not into clearness, but into a darker obscure...

GOVERNESS:
And did they repeat what you said?

MILES:
Oh, yes—they must have repeated them. To those THEY liked.

GOVERNESS:
And these things came round—?

MILES:
To the masters? Oh, yes!... But I didn't know they'd tell.

GOVERNESS:
The masters? They didn't—they've never told. That's why I ask you.

MILES:
Yes, it was too bad.

GOVERNESS:
Too bad?

MILES:
What I suppose I sometimes said. To write home.

GOVERNESS:
Stuff and nonsense! What WERE these things?

NARRATOR:
I sprang straight upon him. For there again, against the glass...

MILES:
Is she HERE?

GOVERNESS:
Miss Jessel, Miss Jessel!

GOVERNESS:
It's not Miss Jessel! But it's at the window—straight before us...

MILES:
It's HE?

GOVERNESS:
Whom do you mean by 'he'?

MILES:
Peter Quint—you devil! WHERE?

GOVERNESS:
What does he matter now, my own?—what will he EVER matter? I have you...

NARRATOR:
I caught him, yes, I held him—it may be imagined with what a passion; but at the end of a minute I began to feel what it truly was that I held. We were alone with the quiet day, and his little heart, dispossessed, had stopped.
