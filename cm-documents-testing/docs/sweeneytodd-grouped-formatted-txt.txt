SWEENEY TODD—THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET -i-^

SCENE:
PROLOGUE::^

DIRECTION:
THE PLACE: London: Fleet Street and environs
THE TIME: The 19th Century
(As the audience enters, an organist takes his place at a huge eccentric organ to the side
of the stage and begins to play funeral music. Before a front drop depicting in a
honeycombed beehive the class system of mid-19th Century England two gravediggers
appear, carrying shovels, and begin to dig a grave downstage center. As they dig they
disappear six feet into the earth, leaving piles of dirt on the upstage side.
At curtain time a police warden appears, looks at his watch, hurrying them. Two
workmen enter. They pull down the drop. The denfeningly shrill sound of a factory
whistle. Blackout.
#1—-—The Ballad of Sweeney Todd
The lights come up to reveal the COMPANY. A MAN steps forward and sings)
MAN (Bass)
ATTEND THE TALE OF SWEENEY TODD.
HIS SKIN WAS PALE AND HIS EYE WAS ODD.
HE SHAVED THE FACES OF GENTLEMEN ,
WHO NEVER THEREAFTER WERE HEARD OF AGAIN,
HE TROD A PATH THAT FEW HAVE TROD,
DID SWEENEY TODD,
THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET.
ANOTHER MAN (Tenor)
HE KEPT A SHOP IN LONDON TOWN,
OF FANCY CLIENTS AND GOOD RENOWN.
AND WHAT IF NONE OF THEIR SOULS WERE SAVED?
THEY WENT TO THEIR MAKER IMPECCABLY SHAVED
BY SWEENEY,
BY SWEENEY TODD,
THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET.

SWEENEY TODD—THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET
(A blinding light cuts down the stage as an upstage iron door opens. Two men enter.
They carry a body in a bag, tied at both ends with rope. They are followed by a woman
carrying a tin canister marked “Flour.” They walk to the edge of the grave and
unceremoniously dump the body in it. The woman opens the canister and pours black
ashes into the hole. This action covers the next verse of the song)^

SCENE:
ACT ONE::^

DIRECTION:
(A street by the London docks. SWEENEY TODD and ANTHONY HOPE enter.
ANTHONY is a cheerful country-born young ship's first mate with a duffel bag slung
over his shoulder. TODD is a heavy-set, saturnine man in his forties who might, say, be
i a blacksmith or a dockhand. There is about him an air of brooding, slightly nerve-chilling
self-absorption)
| ' #2-No Place Like London^

Anthony:
IT HAVE SAILED THE WORLD, BEHELD ITS WONDERS^

From The Dardanelles:
TO THE MOUNTAINS OF PERU,
BUT THERE’S NO PLACE LIKE LONDON!
I FEEL HOME AGAIN.
I COULD HEAR THE CITY BELLS
RING WHATEVER I WOULD DO.
NO, THERE’S NO PL —^

DIRECTION:
(sings grimly)^

DIRECTION:
NO, THERE’S NO PLACE LIKE LONDON.^

DIRECTION:
(surprised at the interruption)^

DIRECTION:
Mr. Todd, sir?^

Todd:
YOU ARE YOUNG.
LIFE HAS BEEN KIND TO YOU.
YOU WILL LEARN.^

DIRECTION:
(music under)^

DIRECTION:
It is here we go our several ways. Farewell, Anthony, I will not soon forget the good
ship “Bountiful” nor the young man who saved my life.
_ ANTHONY
There’s no cause to thank me for that, sir. It would have been a poor Christian
indeed who'd have spotted you pitching and tossing on that raft and not given the
alarm.

DIRECTION:
‘OW WOULD YOU LIKE A LITTLE MUFE, DEAR,
ALITTLE JIG JIG, ,
ALITTLE BOUNCE AROUND THE BUSH?
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO PUSH ME PARSLEY?
YOU LOOKS TO ME, DEAR
LIKE YOU GOT PLENTY THERE TO PUSH!
(As ANTHONY starts back in embarrassment, SHE turns instantly and pathetically to
TODD, who tries to keep his back to her)
ALMS! ... ALMS! ...^

For A Pitiful Woman:
WOT’ S GOT WANDERIN’ WITS ...

What is it?^

Anthony:
T have honored my promise never to question you. Whatever brought you to that
sorry shipwreck is your affair. And yet, during those many weeks of the voyage
home, I have come to think of you as friend and, if trouble lies ahead for you in
London. ... if you need help — or money ...^

(As TODD disappears, we see Mrs. Lovett's Pieshop. Above it is an empty apartment
which is reached by an outside staircase. MRS. LOVETT, a vigorous, slatternly woman
in her forties, is flicking flies off the trays of pies with a dirty rag as SHE sings or hums.
TODD appears at the end of the street and moves slowly toward the pieshop, looking
around as if remembering. Seeing the pieshop, HE pauses a moment at some distance,
gazing at it and at MRS. LOVETT, who has now picked up a wicked-looking knife and
starts chopping suet. After a beat, TODD moves toward the shop, hesitates and then
enters, MRS. LOVETT does not notice him until his shadow passes across her. SHE
looks up, knife in air, and screams, freezing him in his tracks)

(As SHE sings, her narration is acted out. First we see the pretty young WIFE in the
empty upstairs room dancing her household chores. During the following the JUDGE
and his obsequious assistant, the BEADLE, approach the house, gazing up at the WIFE
lecherously. The WIFE remains demure, sewing. The WIFE’s part is mimed by the

OPTIONAL CUT - This scene was cut from the original New York production during
previews for reasons of time. It is included here as an optional scene because the authors
feel it helps particularize JUDGE TURPIN.
If you are not performing #11 - “Johanna,” turn to page 47,
(The lights shift to a room in JUDGE TURPIN’s house, The JUDGE is in his judicial
clothes, a Bible in his hand. In the adjoining room, JOHANNA sits sewing)^

Judge:
Venal young men of the street with only one thought in their heads. But there are
men of different and far higher breed. I have one in mind for you.^

Johanna:
You have?^

Judge:
A gentle man, who would shield you from all earthly cares and guide your faltering
steps to the sober warmth of womanhood — a husband — a protector — and yet an
ardent lover too. It is a man who through all the years has surely earned your affection.

sparsely furnished with a washstand and a long wooden chest. At the foot of the outside
staircase is a brand-new barber's pole. Attached to the first banister of the staircase is an iron
bell. TODD is pacing in the apartment above. MRS. LOVETT comes hurrying out of the
shop, carrying @ wooden chair. As SHE does so, the BEGGAR WOMAN shuffles up to her)

(SHE exits. Music continues. MRS. LOVETT rings the bell to indicate her approach
and starts climbing the stairs, At the sound of the bell, TODD becomes alert and
snatches up a razor. The music becomes agitated. As MRS. LOVETT appears, HE
relaxes somewhat. MRS. LOVETT is now very proprietary towards him)
MRS. LOVETT
It’s not much of a chair, but it'll do till you get your fancy new one. It was me poor

(During this, we have seen ANTHONY moving down the street. HE sees the sign and
stops. HE goes to the bell and rings it, then starts running up the stairs. The effect on
TODD is electric. Even MRS. LOVETT, affected by his tension, alerts. SHE hastily
gives him back the razor. ANTHONY bursts enthusiastically in.)^

A pleasure, ma’am. Oh, Mr. Todd, I have so much to tell you. I have found the fairest
and most loving maid that any man could. dream of! And yet there are problems. She
has a guardian so tyrannical that she is kept shut up from human eye. But now this
morning this key fell from her shuttered window.^

The surest sign that Johanna loves me and ...

Johanna?^

Anthony:
That’s her name, ma’am, and Turpin that of the abominable parent. A judge, it
seems. But, as I said, a monstrous tyrant. Oh Mr. Todd, once the Judge has gone to
court, Ill slip into the house and plead with her to fly with me tonight. Yet when I
have her — where can I bring her till I have hired a coach to speed us home to
Plymouth? Oh Mr, Todd, if I could lodge her here just for an hour or two!^

change that, I will, for if ever there was a maternal heart, it’s mine.
(During this speech PLRELLI, accompanied by TOBIAS, has appeared on the street.
THEY see the sign and start up the stairs without ringing the bell. Now, as MRS.
LOVETT goes to TODD coquetishly, PLRELLI and TOBIAS suddenly appear at the
door, TODD pulls violently away from MRS. LOVETT.)^

around wildly, see the chest, runs to it, opens the lid and then drags PIRELLI to it and
tumbles him in, slamming the lid shut just as TOBIAS enters. It is at this moment that
we realize that one of PIRELLI’s hands is dangling out of the chest)

Tobias:
Oh no, sit. Knowing him, sir, without orders to the contrary, I'd best wait for him here.
(HE crosses to the chest and sits down on it, perilously near PIRELLI's hand, which HE
doesn’t notice. TODD at this moment does, however. Suddenly HE is all nervous
smiles)^

Todd:
So Mrs. Lovett gave you a pie, did she, my lad?^

Slowly now, we see the fingers of PIRELLI’s hand stirring, feebly trying to clutch
TOBIAS’s hand. When it has almost reached him, TODD grabs TOBIAS up off the
chest)^

Todd:
Then why don’t you run downstairs and wait for your master there? There'll be

Judge:
This is the fourth time, sir, that you have been brought before this bench. Though it
is my earnest wish ever to temper justice with mercy, your persistent dedication to a
life of crime is such an abomination before God and man that J have no alternative
but to sentence you to hang by the neck until you are dead.
(HE produces the black cap and puts it on his head. As HE does so the condemned
prisoner is led away)

(During the following, the JUDGE removes cap, wig and gown. To the BEADLE)^

DIRECTION:
Itis perhaps remiss of me to close the court so early, but the stench of those
miserable wretches at the bar was so offensive to my nostrils I feared my eagerness
for fresher air might well impair the soundness of my judgment.
(Light dims on the court and finds the JUDGE, and the BEADLE now walking down a
street together)
: BEADLE
Well, sir, the adjournment is fortunate for me, sit, for it’s today we celebrate my
sweet little Annie’s birthday, and to have her daddy back so soon to hug and kiss her
will be her crowning joy on such a happy day.^

Judge:
Itis a happy moment for me, too. Walk home with me for I have news for you. In
order to shield her from the evils of this world, I have decided to marry Johanna next
Monday.^

Beadle:
Ah, sit, happy news indeed.^

Judge:
Strange, when I offered myself to her, she showed a certain reluctance. But that’s
natural enough in a young girl. Now that she has had time for reflection, I’m sure
she will greet my proposal in a more sensible frame of mind.
(Light leaves them and comes up on JOHANNA and ANTHONY in JOHANNA’s
room. SHE is pacing in agitation and fear)^

SHE looks in it)
Three quid! Well, waste not, want not, as I always say.

away when something about it attracts her. SHE slips it too down her dress, SHE shuts

(Thanks to her increasing prosperity, MRS. LOVETT has created a modest outdoor
enting garden outside the pieshop, consisting of a large wooden table with two benches,
a few bushes in pots, birds in cages. At rise, contented customers, one of whom is
drunk, are filling the garden, devouring their pies and drinking ale while TOBIAS, ina
waiter’s apron, drums up trade along the sidewalk. Inside the pieshop, MRS. LOVETT, |
in a “fancy” gown, a sign of her upward mobility, doles out pies from the counter and |
collects a few on a tray to bring into the garden subsequently. TODD is pacing
restlessly in the tonsorial parlor. The BEGGAR WOMAN hangs around throughout, |
hungry and ominous) |^

aware of MRS. LOVETT, in a white nightdress, inside the bakehouse. The oven doors are
open and cast a hot light. SHE is tossing “objects” into the oven, As the music continues
under, a figure stumbles into view from the alleyway beside the chimney. It is the
BEGGAR WOMAN, coughing and spitting and carrying a meager straw pallet, her bed)^

rising above the bizarre cacophony, we hear JOHANNA's voice from inside a window,
singing a snatch of “Green Finch and Linnet Bird.” A few moments later, SHE breaks
off singing and the inmates quieten too as ANTHONY, dejected, enters, As HE starts
across the stage, once again we hear JOHANNA'’s voice, singing)^

rocks it in her arms)^

feels it, opens a window. Sees a baby, screams and wails. Clutches baby to her, pats and
rocks it.)

to tug the skirt away from the vise-like grip)
MRS. LOVETT
Die! Die! God in heaven— die!
(The JUDGE’s fingers relax their grip; HE is dead. Panting, MRS, LOVETT backs
away from him and for the first time notices the body of the BEGGAR WOMAN. SHE
