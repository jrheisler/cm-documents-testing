THE MAN IN BLACK:
This is the Man in Black, here to introduce Columbia's program ... "SUSPENSE." Tonight, as we premiere our new Saturday evening series on the air, Miss Agnes Moorehead returns to our stage to appear in the study in terror by Lucille Fletcher called, "Sorry, Wrong Number." This story of a woman who accidentally overheard a conversation with death, and who strove frantically to prevent murder from claiming an innocent victim, is being repeated by popular request as tonight's tale of ... suspense. If you've been with us before, you will know that "SUSPENSE" is compounded of mystery and suspicion and dangerous adventure. In this series are tales calculated to intrigue you, to stir your nerves, to offer you a precarious situation and then ... withhold the solution ... until the last possible moment. And so it is with the story "Sorry, Wrong Number" and the performance of Miss Agnes Moorehead, we again hope to keep you in ...^

OPERATOR:
(ON FILTER) Your call, please?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Operator, I've been dialing Murray Hill 7-0093 now for the last three quarters of an hour and the line is always busy. I don't see how it could be busy that long. Will you try it for me, please?^

OPERATOR:
(ON FILTER) I will be glad to try that number for you. One moment, please.^

SOUND:
OPERATOR DIALS NUMBER UNDER FOLLOWING^phone_dialed_ring_4.mp3

MRS. STEVENSON:
(RAMBLING, FULL OF SELF-PITY) I don't see how it could be busy all this time. It's my husband's office. He's working late tonight, and I'm all alone here in the house. My health is very poor and I've been feeling so nervous all day.^

OPERATOR:
(ON FILTER) Ringing Murray Hill 7-0093.^

MAN'S VOICE:
(FILTER) (HEAVY, TOUGH VOICE) Hello?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Hello...? (A LITTLE PUZZLED) Hello. Is - is Mr. Stevenson there?^

MAN'S VOICE:
(AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT HEARD) Hello? (LOUDER) Hello?^

2ND MAN'S VOICE:
(FILTER) (ALSO OVER TELEPHONE BUT FARTHER AWAY ... A VERY DISTINCTIVE QUALITY) Hello.^

1ST MAN:
Hello. George?^

GEORGE:
Yes, sir. This is George speaking.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(LOUDER AND MORE IMPERIOUS) Hello. Who's this? What number am I calling, please?^

1ST MAN:
I'm here with our client.^

GEORGE:
(PLEASED) Oh ... good. Is everything okay? Is the coast clear for tonight?^

1ST MAN:
Yeah, George. He says the coast is clear for tonight.^

GEORGE:
Okay, okay.^

1ST MAN:
Where are you now?^

GEORGE:
In a phone booth. Don't worry. Everything's okay.^

1ST MAN:
Very well. You know the address?^

GEORGE:
Yeah, yeah, I know. At eleven o'clock the private patrolman goes around to the bar on Second Avenue for a beer.^

1ST MAN:
That's right. At eleven o'clock.^

GEORGE:
I will make sure that all the lights downstairs are out.^

1ST MAN:
There should be only one light, visible from the street.^

GEORGE:
Yeah, yeah, I know. At eleven-fifteen a train crosses the bridge. It makes a noise, in case her window's open and she should scream.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(SHOCKED) Oh! ... Hello? What number is this, please?^

GEORGE:
Okay. I understand, I tell you. That's eleven-fifteen, the train.^

1ST MAN:
Yeah. You remember everything else, George?^

GEORGE:
Yeah, yeah, I make it quick. As little blood as possible ...^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(GASPS IN HORROR)^

GEORGE:
... because ... (AS IF AMUSED) our client does not wish to make her suffer long.^

1ST MAN:
That's right. You'll use a knife?^

GEORGE:
Yes. A knife will be okay. And afterwards I remove the rings and the bracelets and the jewelry in the bureau drawer. Because ... our client wishes it to look like simple robbery. Don't worry. Everything's okay. I never ma--^

SOUND:
SHE HANGS UP, THEN PICKS UP PHONE AND DIALS, MUMBLING "OPERATOR" TO HERSELF, AMONG OTHER THINGS ... RING 4TIMES^slams_phone_dial_ring_4.mp3

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) Your call, please?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(UNNERVED AND BREATHLESS) Operator, I've just been cut off.^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) I'm sorry. What number were you calling?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(RAPIDLY) Why, it was supposed to be Murray Hill 7-0093 but it wasn't. Some wires must have crossed -- I was cut into a wrong number and I -- I - I've just heard the most dreadful thing -- something about a - a murder and -- operator, you simply have to retrace that call at once!^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) I beg your pardon? May I help you?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(FRANTIC) Oh, I know it was a wrong number, and I had no business listening, but these two men -- they were cold-blooded fiends -- and they were going to murder somebody, some poor innocent woman, who was all alone in a house near a bridge and we've got to stop them -- we've got to --^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) (PATIENTLY) Uh, what number were you calling, please?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Well, that doesn't matter. This was a wrong number. And you dialed it for me. And we've got to find out what it was immediately!^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) What number did you call?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Oh, why are you so stupid? What time is it? Do you mean to tell me you can't find out what that number was just now?^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) I'll connect you with the Chief Operator.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Oh, I think it's perfectly shameful. Now, look. Look -- it was obviously a case of some little slip of the finger. I told you to try Murray Hill 7-0093 for me. You dialed it but your finger must have slipped and I was connected with some other number -- and I could hear them, but they couldn't hear me. Now, I - I - I simply fail to see why you couldn't make that same mistake again on purpose -- why you couldn't try to dial Murray Hill 7-0093 in the same sort of careless way --^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) Murray Hill 7-0093?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Yes!^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) I'll try to get it for you.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Well, thank you.^

OPERATOR DIALS -- THEN THE BUSY SIGNAL^phone_dialed_busy_signal.mp3

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) I'm sorry. Murray Hill 7-0093 is busy. I'll call you in twenty minutes--^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Operator! Operator! Operator! Operator!^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) Your call, please?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
You didn't try to get that wrong number at all. I asked you explicitly and all you did was dial correctly.^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) I'm sorry. What number are you calling?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Well, can't you, for once, forget what number I'm calling and do something for me? Now I want to trace that call. It's my civic duty and it's your civic duty to trace that call and to apprehend those dangerous killers -- and if you won't...^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) I will connect you with the Chief Operator.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Please!^

SOUND:
RINGS FOUR TIMES^ring_4.mp3

MRS. STEVENSON:
(UNDER HER BREATH) Oh, dear ...^

CHIEF OPERATOR:
(FILTER) This is the Chief Operator.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Oh, uh, Chief Operator. I want you to trace a call, a telephone call, immediately. I don't know where it came from, or who was making it, but it's absolutely necessary that it be tracked down. Because it was about a murder that someone's planning -- a terrible, cold-blooded murder of a poor innocent woman, tonight, at eleven-fifteen.^

CHIEF OPERATOR:
(FILTER) I see.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(HIGH-STRUNG, DEMANDING) Well, can you trace it for me? Can you track down those men?^

CHIEF OPERATOR:
(FILTER) I'm not certain. It depends.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Depends on what?^

CHIEF OPERATOR:
It depends on whether the call is still going on. If it's a live call, we can trace it on the equipment. If it's been disconnected, we can't.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Disconnected?^

CHIEF OPERATOR:
(FILTER) If the parties have stopped talking to each other.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Oh, but of course they must have stopped talking to each other by now. That was at least five minutes ago and they didn't sound like the type who would make a long call.^

CHIEF OPERATOR:
(FILTER) Well -- I can try tracing it. May I have your name, please?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Mrs. Stevenson. Mrs. Elbert Stevenson. But, listen --^

CHIEF OPERATOR:
(FILTER) (INTERRUPTING) And your telephone number, please?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Plaza 4-2295. But if you go on wasting all this time --^

CHIEF OPERATOR:
(FILTER) Why do you want this call traced, please?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Wha--? I-- Well -- no reason. I - I mean, I merely felt very strongly that something ought to be done about it. These men sounded like killers -- they're dangerous, they're going to murder this woman at eleven-fifteen tonight and I thought the police ought to know.^

CHIEF OPERATOR:
(FILTER) Have you reported this to the police?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Well ... No. Not yet.^

CHIEF OPERATOR:
(FILTER) You want this call checked purely as a private individual?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Yes, yes. But meanwhile --^

CHIEF OPERATOR:
(FILTER) I'm sorry, Mrs. Stevenson, but I'm afraid we couldn't make this check for you and trace the call just on your say-so as a private individual. We'd have to have something more official.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Oh, for heaven's sake. You mean to tell me I can't report that there's gonna be a murder without getting tied up in all this red tape? Why, it's perfectly idiotic! (BEAT) Well, all right. I'll call the police.^

CHIEF OPERATOR:
(FILTER) Thank you. I'm sure that would be the best way to--^

SOUND:
SHE SLAMS DOWN THE RECEIVER^slams_phone_dial_ring_5.mp3

MRS. STEVENSON:
Ridiculous! Perfectly ridiculous!^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(UNDER HER BREATH) The thought of it! ... I can't see why I have to go to all this trouble... (IMPATIENT AT THE THIRD RING) Oh ...!^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) Your call, please?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
The Police Department. Get me the Police Department -- please!^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) Thank you.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
RINGS THREE TIMES ... MRS. STEVENSON KEEPS MUTTERING UNDER HER BREATH^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) (BORED WITH HIS NIGHT DUTY ASSIGNMENT) Police Station, Precinct 43, Sergeant Martin speaking.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Police Department? Ah, this is Mrs. Stevenson -- Mrs. Elbert Smythe Stevenson of 53 North Sutton Place. I'm calling up to report a murder. I mean (FUMBLING FOR WORDS) -- the murder hasn't been committed yet but I just overheard plans for it over the telephone -- over a wrong number that the operator gave me. I've been trying to trace down the call myself -- but everybody is so stupid -- and I guess in the end you're the only people who can do anything.^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) (NOT TOO IMPRESSED BY ALL THIS) Yes, ma'am.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(TRYING TO IMPRESS HIM) It was a perfectly definite murder. I heard their plans distinctly. Two men were talking and they were going to murder some woman at eleven-fifteen tonight. She lived in a house near a bridge. (BEAT) Are - are you listening to me?^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) Yes. Uh, yes, ma'am.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
And there was a private patrolman on the street. He was going to go around for a beer on Second Avenue. And there was some third man -- a client who was paying to have this poor woman murdered. They were going to take her rings and bracelets and - and use a knife... Well -- it - it's unnerved me dreadfully -- (REACHING THE BREAKING POINT) -- and I'm not well -- and I feel so nerv--^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) I see. (STOLIDLY) When was all this, ma'am?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
About eight minutes ago. (RELIEVED) Then - then you can do something? You do understand --^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) What is your name, ma'am?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(IMPATIENT) Mrs. Stevenson. Mrs. Elbert Stevenson.^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) And your address?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
53 North Sutton Place. Five-three North Sutton Place. That's near a bridge. The Queensboro Bridge, you know and -- and - and we have a private patrolman on our street... and Second Avenue --^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) And what was that number you were calling?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Murray Hill 7-0093. But that wasn't the number I overheard. I mean Murray Hill 7-0093 is my husband's office. He's working late tonight and I was trying to reach him to ask him to come home. I'm an invalid, you know, and it's the maid's night off and I hate to be alone, even though he says I'm perfectly safe as long as I have the telephone right beside my bed.^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) (STOLIDLY) Well, we'll look into it, Mrs. Stevenson, and see if we can check it with the telephone company.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(GETTING IMPATIENT) But the telephone company said they couldn't check the call if the parties had stopped talking. I've already taken care of that!^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) (A FAINT HINT OF SARCASM) Oh, you have?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(HIGH-HANDED) Yes. And, personally, I feel you ought to do something far more immediate and drastic than just check the call. What good does checking the call do if they've stopped talking? By the time you tracked it down they'll already have committed the murder.^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) (GIVING HER THE "BRUSH OFF") Well, we'll take care of it. Don't you worry.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Well, I'd say the whole thing calls for a search, a complete and thorough search of the whole city. Now, I'm very near the bridge and I'm not far from Second Avenue -- and I know I'd feel a whole lot better if you sent around a radio car to this neighborhood at once!^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) And what makes you think the murder's going to be committed in your neighborhood, ma'am?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Well, I -- Oh, I don't know. Only the coincidence is so horrible. Second Avenue -- the patrolman -- the bridge.^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) Second Avenue is a very long street, ma'am. And you know how many bridges there are in the city of New York alone?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Yes, I know--^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) Not to mention Brooklyn, Staten Island, Queens, and the Bronx.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
I know that!^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) How do you know there isn't some little house on Staten Island on some little Second Avenue you've never even heard about? How do you know they're even talking about New York at all?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
But I heard the call on the New York dialing system.^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) Maybe it was a long-distance call you overheard.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Oh, don't--^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) Telephones are funny things. Look, lady, why don't you look at it this way? Supposing you hadn't broken in on that telephone call? Supposing you'd got your husband the way you always do. You wouldn't be so upset, would you?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Well, no, I suppose not. Only it sounded so inhuman -- so cold-blooded.^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) A lot of murders are plotted in this city every day, ma'am. We manage to prevent almost all of 'em.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
But--^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) But a clue of this kind is so vague -- it isn't much more use to us than no clue at all.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
But, surely, you --^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) Unless, of course, you have some reason for thinking this call was phony and -- that someone may be planning to murder you.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Me? Oh -- oh, no -- no, I hardly think so. I -- I mean, why should anybody? I'm alone all day and night. I see nobody except my maid, Eloise, and -- she's a big girl, she weighs two hundred pounds -- she's too lazy to bring up my breakfast tray and -- the only other person is my husband, Elbert. He's crazy about me -- he - he just adores me. He waits on me hand and foot. He's scarcely left my side since I took sick, well, twelve years ago....^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) Well, then, there's nothing for you to worry about. Now, if you'll just leave the rest of this to us, we'll take care of it.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(NOT COMPLETELY MOLLIFIED) But what will you do? It's so late ... it's nearly eleven now!^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) (MORE FIRMLY) We'll take care of it, lady.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Will you broadcast it all over the city? And send out squads? And warn your radio cars to watch out -- especially in suspicious neighborhoods like mine --^

SERGEANT MARTIN:
(FILTER) Lady, I said we'd take care of it. Just now I've got a couple of other matters here on my desk that require immediate attention. Good night, ma'am, and thank you.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Oh, you--! You--!^

SOUND:
SHE SLAMS DOWN THE RECEIVER HARD^slams_phone_dial_ring_5.mp3

MRS. STEVENSON:
Idiot! Oh, now, why did I hang up the phone like that? He'll think I am a fool! (PAUSE) Oh -- why doesn't Elbert come home? Why doesn't he? Why doesn't he come home?^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) Your call, please?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Operator, for heaven's sake, will you ring that Murray Hill 7-0093 number again? I can't think what's keeping him so long!^

(TO HERSELF, ON THE SECOND RING) Why doesn't she answer?^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) Your call, please?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Hello, Operator, I don't know what's the matter with this telephone tonight, but it's positively driving me crazy. I've never seen such inefficient, miserable service. Now, now, look. I'm an invalid, and I'm very nervous, and I'm not supposed to be annoyed. But if this keeps on much longer...^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) What seems to be the trouble, please?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Well, everything's wrong! I haven't had one bit of satisfaction out of one call I've made this evening! The whole world could be murdered for all you people care. And now my phone keeps ringing and ringing and ringing and ringing every five seconds and when I pick it up there's no one there!^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) I'm sorry. If you will hang up, I will test it for you.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
I don't want you to test it for me! I want you to put that call through, whatever it is, at once!^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) I'm afraid I cannot do that.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
You can't?!? And why -- why, may I ask?^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) The dial system is automatic.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
(GASPS IN EXASPERATION)^

OPERATOR:
(FILTER) If someone is trying to dial your number, there is no way to check it if the call is coming through the system or not -- unless the person who's trying to reach you complains to his particular operator.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Well, of all the stupid -- and meanwhile I've got to sit here in my bed, suffering every time that phone rings, imagining everything ...^

OPERATOR:

MRS. STEVENSON:
Check it! Check it! That's all anybody can do! Oh, what's the use of talking to you? You're so stupid!^

Young woman, I don't know your name. But there are ways of finding you out. And I'm going to report you to your superiors for the most unpardonable rudeness and insolence it's ever been my privilege-- Give me the business office at once!^

WOMAN:
(FILTER) I see. And what is the nature of the case, madam?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Nerves. I'm very nervous. I need soothing -- companionship. You see, my husband is away and I'm--^

WOMAN:
(FILTER) Have you been recommended to us by any doctor in particular, madam?^

MRS. STEVENSON:
No. But I really don't see why all this catechizing is necessary. I just want a trained nurse. I was a patient in your hospital two years ago. And after all, I do expect to pay this person for attending me.^

WOMAN:
(FILTER) We quite understand that, madam. But these are war times, you know.^

MRS. STEVENSON:
Well--^

WOMAN:

MRS. STEVENSON:
That -- that click -- just now, in my own telephone. As though someone had lifted the receiver off the hook of the extension telephone downstairs.^

WOMAN:
(FILTER) Well, I didn't hear it, madam. Now, about this--^

MRS. STEVENSON:
